Reference 2 Name: Michael Luessi
Reference 2 Notes: Tom is pretty well-known around here in the Milwaukee area. They operate a design and construction company. He helped them with formation, Operating agreement etc. and most recently, removing a partner over three years. He himself handled it in arbitration (curious). but brought other firm in for the last hearing. ""Lots of respect for him, always follows through, etc."". Reference was shyish/nerdy engineer, so not enthusiastic, but very positive review. Indicates probably not much work going forward though, and the client himself is not sophisticated as to legal work apparently.

Reference 3 Name: Mike Violeo
Reference 3 Notes: Client of Thomas. Helped negotiate a savings of $500,000 on a sale price so was very impressed. Worked together on sale of business in 2002. Been friendly ever since, golf outings, etc. Very responsive. He worked recently with Tom for something for his son (wasn't very clear) on this. Doesn't have reservations - complete confidence and trust.

According to my recruiter, Daniel was quick and strong in his decision in regards to his interest in Rimon. He’s highly analytical and initially was a man of few words. However, he did reiterate his interest throughout the call and at the end, asked her if he could call and meet with Richard first and then schedule something with Mr. Shelton. She told him that would be fine.

Apparently, Dan Herling was not receiving the emails from you. He spoke with his clients without releasing Rimon's name and also thought about joining Rimon long and hard. He believes the platform just doesn't make sense for his practice. He needs teams to assist him on his cases. He thinks Rimon is fully of a bunch of great lawyers and he truly believes Rimon represents the future, but for his current cases, Rimon doesn’t yet have the support he needs to ensure success. After speaking with his clients, they weren't too thrilled about changing.

Staff: He currently works with a research person, docketing clerk, patent and trademark docketing clerk, paralegals, legal secretary, billing and finance professionals, and marketing team. Billing and accounting and marketing we can handle, but we're not in good shape for his practice wrt to the other categories. We'd need a paralegal and secretary on the East Coast - I don't see our staff out in SF having bandwidth or capabilities to take on a practice of this size. So not only would that be a bottleneck, we'd also have to find staff that can handle docketing both on litigation and in USPTO hearings, because we can't support full-time docketing clerks. Frankly, I'm not sure whether that exists. In any event, if he's serious, we'd need to put all hands on decks right away to try. 

2. Lawyers - he needs a variety of lawyers to support his practice, in different sciences. So even though he can only support one, maybe two lwyers, he needs a variety to be able to do the work he needs. He knows of a few people that could join the network and help out. If those work out, he would probably need one full-time of counsel type, but also ""junior associate support"" from time to time. At the very least, we'd need to find an excellent IP litigator full time (not just John Hintz, it seems), also before he joins.

Presenting to Firm/Reviewing K,"From recruiter in initial intro: 

Stephen’s financial situation is such that he feels he needs some sort of minimal base salary to deal with some expenses and to do some marketing travel to Croatia and some other places to reconnect with all of his contacts and sources. Drinker Biddle is discussing giving him some sort of draw or base salary that would be the equivalent of what they pay a 5th or 6th year associate.
 
Based upon what I told Stephen about Rimon he realizes that your firm model is probably not really set up to pay base salaries, draws and guaranteed compensation, so he wonders if the following might be a way of addressing this issue in a manner that would not offend “the system” at Rimon. He would like to know if, assuming he joined Rimon, would Rimon consider providing him a “a one-time advance” that he would be obligated to repay out of his first receipts or by the end of a specific period of time. He is hoping that Rimon might consider thinking of it as some kind of signing compensation, rather than some deviation from the presumed Rimon policy that you probably don’t generally do draws.  Stephen hopes that by requiring Stephen to repay the advance, that this would further be in sync with your firm’s policy or structure.

 I think he is inclined to accept an offer from Rimon. He seems motivated and he really likes the business model, the law firm attitude, and the people.
 
From recruiter after meeting with Trachtenberg and Monsanto:

I see only two items that could pose potential obstacles.
 
1.      I don’t have any idea what other offer(s) he might get from some other firm such as Drinker Biddle. I think he would prefer Rimon over any other firm, all things being equal. However, another firm might make an offer that is too attractive economically in terms of guaranteed compensation which could render both offers unequal and tip the balance to the other firm; and
 

2.      Related to the first item, as I mentioned in my original profile of Stephen, he needs some sort of cash advance, if not a modest base salary. I don’t know if Stephen has any precise number in mind. For your convenience and to refresh your memory, here is what I wrote on this subject in my introduction of Stephen’s candidacy:

 
“Stephen’s candidacy at Rimon would otherwise seem like a no-brainer, but here is the ‘fly in the ointment.’ Stephen’s financial situation is such that he feels he needs some sort of minimal base salary to deal with some expenses and to do some marketing travel to Croatia and some other places to reconnect with all of his contacts and sources. [Drinker Biddle] is discussing giving him some sort of draw or base salary that would be the equivalent of what they pay a 5th or 6th year associate.
 
Based upon what I told Stephen about Rimon he realizes that your firm model is probably not really set up to pay base salaries, draws and guaranteed compensation, so he wonders if the following might be a way of addressing this issue in a manner that would not offend ‘the system’ at Rimon. He would like to know if, assuming he joined Rimon, would Rimon consider providing him a ‘a one-time advance’ that he would be obligated to repay out of his first receipts or by the end of a specific period of time. He is hoping that Rimon might consider thinking of it as some kind of signing compensation, rather than some deviation from the presumed Rimon policy that you probably don’t generally do draws.  Stephen hopes that by requiring Stephen to repay the advance, that this would further be in sync with your firm’s policy or structure.”
 
It is my understanding  that there has not been any discussion on this issue to date, so obviously you would have to come to some resolution before Stephen would be in a position to accept an offer.

Very collegial, easy to work with, never had any arguments or difficulties during their time together, no contentious issues about money, etc. Honest, integrity, etc. 

On the merger - confirmed Stephen's story that he didn't get a satisfactory offer.
Crowell - doesn't know whole details, but seemed to think it had to do with business that did or didn't come over. Seems consistent with Stephen's story.

High marks for skills as a lawyer.

“Based on the fact that the two of you will need a couple associates and paralegals as well at a legal secretary and an office, I would put your personal income on $1.5 - $2M at somewhere between $600K+ to possibly $1M.”

MATT POPPE, NOTES FROM LUNCH MEET:
I wouldn't oppose an offer if others felt strongly, but he didn't fill me with enthusiasm.  He didn't give me the sense that he has either a strong active docket or much chance of cross-selling.  I don't recall him mentioning any specific clients other than the University of Southern California.  He doesn't have IPR experience, so I wouldn't be able to collaborate with him on patent litigation.  His ideas about a patent prosecution referral service seemed interesting, but I think our leadership's energy is better spent on other forms of law firm innovation.  Finally, Jonathan didn't impress me from a personality standpoint the way others at Rimon have.  With that said, Jim's input is probably more important than mine as I would expect him to have more opportunities to refer work to a patent prosecutor than I do.",,,"Warner Brothers, a Foundation in Moscow, USC",,,,IP LItigation,Management Stucture;Lack of Bureaucracy;Flexibility in billing;Opportunity to be on cutting edge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But that said, it seems doubtful he fits the bill of a Rimon partner based on experience alone. His first job in the US, at Bay Area IP Group (oddly based in Reno) was for the stated reason of ""just finding somewhere to do his OPT"" (post school visa work). So his experience there wasn't very material. Then he went to ANBO for 8 months, left there, went to another firm in China for 7 months where he was a partner (although I'm not sure what that means, give he was pretty junior), but left it because he didn't like the firm and went back to the first firm. He now practices under the practice of an immigration attorney, Shen, in association with ANBO, although ""not really part of the firm"". So he doesn't have any history of working in a sophisticated platform for any extended period of time. Closest that comes to this is Baker, but that was very junior for two years.

He also certainly can't draft agreements in English, so the question is whether he'd just be practicing Chinese law?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Examples of work he's done for him: dealing with tenant who skimped out on security deposit, collecting on debt that was owed to him (all individual matters). He's worked with other lawyers and greatly prefers Jeff.  .

Clearly stated she would keep using Paul if he joins Rimon. Says Paul can be trusted to help get the best result for the client - including helping to settle when in the best interest of the client, even if not best for lawyers. This has been a great difference from all the other lawyers they work with. Knows how to tackle a case in an efficient way, understanding the parameters of a case and the practically of legal spend. Works with a lot of lawyers and finds Paul's legal acumen to be top-notch. Unequivocally vouches for his honesty and integrity and volunteered that ""Paul is just a great guy"". She knows Pamela Egan from Pachelski days, but not very well.

James Bord (client): Gives over $1M in legal work to different lawyers, and finds that Paul is most efficient, clear, and easy to work with.

He plans to give more work to Paul moving forward, whether or not he is at Rimon.",BNY Mellon is his largest client - this is a large reason he likes Rimon: saw they are already a client.

REGARDING BILLINGS 2015vs2016: In each of the last 2 years a significant amount of my billings came from one time, non-recurring events.  

In 2015, a client I originated, FieldOne. was sold to Microsoft.   We represented the company in the sale, which was a significant part of my billings for the year.  In 2016, there was some post-closing work, but that is mostly done.    The former CEO of FieldOne recently has become the CEO of another area company and I do anticipate receiving work from them in 2017, but initially not at that magnitude.

Similarly, in 2016 a client I originated, Gerald Minkowitz, was sued and the litigation has generated a large amount of fees.  Although I believe I will have a role in the case until it settles/goes to trial, I do not believe the work will transition from McCarter (too much institutional knowledge of the case to transition).  Dr. Minkowitz is now working on other investments, so I believe that the work will continue, but again, not at the same magnitude.

I prefer to under-promise, over-deliver and my estimate reflects that.  To be clear, it does not reflect any desire on my part to dial back my practice.  On the contrary, I believe the Rimon platform will allow me to grow my practice.  One of the major appeals of Rimon to me is the billing flexibility to pitch to clients to be a ""Fractional-GC""  on a flat-fee basis. Given my background, I believe that is my sweet-spot, but it is not cost effective at $495 an hour.  In addition, I believe that at Rimon I will have the flexibility to make multiple trips to Israel and make a serious business development drive.  I am already targeting trips in February and May that will center on major venture industry events, but include many other meetings.","Tim Gladden, Carl Sherer, Melinda Bramwit","Andrew Garman - used Dror when he had fairly complicated transactions when he was at his prior firm.

These deals are rarely hostile and while there are a few major contentious issues that, like every deal, seem to pop up .. they are usually business or financial points or get resolved through reasonable discussions and compromises reached.
 
Bottom line, unless the recruit is representing Chase Paymentech directly in the credit card or payment processing business, it’s unlikely there would be a real conflict and I would find it difficult to believe the conflict issue hasn’t come up time and time again for anyone representing a major global financial institution

Making over $600K – how much over?

From Frederick: This is a BIG Picture thinker and his opinion of (old school) law firm management is very low.
He’s got a $100M case that he believes he’ll get – regardless of where he’s practicing. He talked about the need for associates but if we can evidence specific lawyers who could staff his case, as well as discuss our desire to grow a national and international practice, he’ll be excited about that. Definitely talk about the 34.7% cross-selling and how the transactional-heavy roster will work in his favor IF he’s good at internal marketing. Even though he has a solid client base, his belief is that internal referrals are paramount to a successful comm lit practice, because of the ebbs and flows of settlements etc…
He’s very outgoing and talkative so let him do most of it. He uses analogies very effectively e.g. he brought up that he crewed at Yale and coached the boats at U. Va., and that oftentimes, law firm management is like having someone on board who is either not rowing or rowing in the opposite direction. 
He really does have tremendous business acumen so management by “Coloring Books & Crayons” as he puts it, drives him crazy. The boutique he’s considering will have the same mindset so acknowledge how highly I feel about his business mind, and how valuable he could be in helping us recruit and vet potential candidates – something he is VERY interested in doing for us.
If he believes we can provide the support needed, that internal marketing will eventually bear fruit (I promised $0.00 but said the formula speaks for itself, as do the numbers), and are truly set on growing a national litigation practice, he’ll join.",,No,,No,No,Commercial Litigation,,"Monsanto, Lisa-Marie;Moradzadeh, Michael",zcrm_1837424000000110044,,,,,Other: see notes section,,,Corporate and Business Transactions;Litigation,Collaboration model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These have included Chevron, ExxonMobil, China National Petroleum Corporation, Total, Shell, Eni, Inpex and others.  I also act for engineering and oil services firms, such as Fluor Corporation, Halliburton, Parker Drilling, and others.  During the past year, I have also begun to consult to renewable energy investors that are clients of other Dechert partners, which are considering major solar and wind projects in Kazakhstan.
I have attached an Excel sheet that provides annual revenues from clients of the Almaty office of which I have been managing partner since 2005 (first at Chadbourne & Parke, and then at Dechert).    
I can provide a breakdown of the fees paid by specific clients each year during the past several years.  However, I should emphasize that my interest in Rimon is predicated on pursuing a different approach for my practice.  My practice has always focused on having an office in Kazakhstan and a team of Kazakhstani lawyers.  This has required that I live in Kazakhstan or constantly commute to Kazakhstan to administer the office.  The product that we offer is one in which the clients rely upon our having a Kazakhstan legal team on the ground.  This has been successful when I have lived in Kazakhstan; it has faced challenges when I have lived in Washington, DC and commuted to Almaty.
I am now considering disengaging from the model of relying on a Kazakhstan office, in order to build an international energy and infrastructure practice.  I would, of course, need to start with matters pertaining to Kazakhstan, where I have experience and connections.

worked together in Solicitor's office. She was Laurel's direct boss (Laurel was a line solicitor and she was deputy chief). Thinks very highly of her, strategic thinker, good analytical skills. (Didn't recall exactly what areas she handled). Writing skills were excellent. Became friendly with her - very warm, open person. No red flags other than generally that she's been out of the workforce for a little while, but nothing of concern in the time they worked together.

BUZ BARCLAY says: My great friend and admin for 14 years and two law firms worked for a name partner at RKO after we parted ways in 2005. She retired from RKO about four years ago. She told me last night that one time (could have been from 5-10 years ago) Brian had been tough on his former admin, which information went around the office, and when Brian was then interviewing my friend as a potential replacement, she told him she knew about the other situation and she would break his legs and teeth if he ever demonstrated any disrespect. Did I mention she is from a certain Italian family in the Philly area and was raised by nuns in the convent next door? 

 Brian apparently believed her, which reflected a degree of sensitivity, and he decided to take a different person as his new admin, which did not surprise her.  My friend says that Brian was known as a hard worker and she never heard of any other issues with him. She would have heard, if there had been any. 

My friend says she has heard recently from other admins still there that RKO is really having a very hard time, and even ""falling apart.""

He did say the he liked her a lot, that she was easy to get along with, left on great terms etc, The overall general feel was certainly positive, not negative.

For instance, when asked about her technical skills, he said he had to admit that ""she was a partner, so he didn't really supervise her work, but that he certainly never heard anything bad or adverse."" I probed and asked if they had any mutual clients, where he might have seen her work, but he said he didn't recall. He perhaps mentioned how the ""diversity"" aspects of bringing in were important a few too many times. I asked how she fit in to a law firm setting - getting along with partners, relating to staff, and he equivocated a bit, saying that transitioning from government to private practice is hard, so there were naturally some transition bumps, etc. but that it worked out fine. Feeling the need to probe a little more, I asked if, money aside, if he could bring her to his present firm, would he? The answer was that he would strongly consider it, etc, but not a definite yes. He said something about how just because you have a lot of contacts, doesn't mean that turning those into clients is easy. Pressing the question another way, I asked if she had a $2M book, would the decision be easy to bring her in. And he finally said, yes, I think that would be easy.

Hired,"From Lisa Burns after second meeting with Patricia:

I met with Patricia, again, and her colleague, Eric Karlberg, yesterday afternoon for about an hour.  I really think they are interested, but these seem to be the lingering questions:
(1)    The hurdle of transition, especially with almost 5000 clients. Now, I don’t know if all of these clients are still actual clients.  I suspect that these are all people she has dealt with over the last 30 years, but the vast majority of them are probably not active clients, and could have even moved on to another attorney, and she doesn’t even know (having now transitioned to new firms twice in the last 10 years, I have found this to be the case, of course to a much smaller degree.  However, to the extent that she even has half of this clientele, and they come with her, it will be a monumental task for any client service rep and any admin here in Boston.  We need to be able to reassure her that we will provide the resources necessary to make this leap.  By the way, Bill Long, from Chicago, had similar concerns, so if we can bridge this gap for Patricia, we may well be able to bridge it for him too.  This goes for file storage (too vast to turn digital – probably can only do going forward for client matters), as well as original estate planning documents.  For example, I currently fill 1 full fire proof filing cabinet to the brim and we’ve just gotten a second because not another sheet of paper could fit in the first.  It sounds like Patricia has 4-5 of these cabinets currently!  They cost approximately $2-3k/cabinet and they are heavy so they have to be spread out in a floor plan.  So as you can see, these logistics are very real and very much a concern for someone like Patricia (and Bill Long to a lesser extent).  Hiring some dedicated temps to focus just on transition may be the answer. (more in Private Management Notes)",Received,No,Received,Yes,Yes,Trusts and Estates,,"Burns, Lisa;Moradzadeh, Michael;Rose, Filmore;Ross, Scott",zcrm_1837424000000110028,"(continued from Private Frederick/Mgmt notes from Lisa Burns):

(2)    Will the model work for her kind of leveraging work down to Eric and to an associate, and to a lesser extent, a paralegal?  I think it should, but it also depends on how she structures things, especially with Eric.  Currently he is of counsel, and works on a contractual basis where he gets a percentage of the dollars collected on the work he performs (I think).  They didn’t give me a ton of details.  I told them that there are many ways to set this up.  Just as we had discussed in our very first telephone call, different groups do things differently. I tried to give her examples, but I think that you are in the best position to run through this with her.  Clearly Scott and I run our practices very similarly with respect to our employees.  However, I know that Frank does something else with respect to his son and Jennifer Dassari.   You have much more information on what combinations might work financially, so it may make sense for you or Yaacov to run through the numbers with her using various methods to see what could possibly work best.  I have sent her and Eric an excel spreadsheet that my husband put together when Deb and I were considering this move.  It is fairly simple in that you estimate what hours you might collect for any given person in your group and at what rate, and then you can figure out other’s costs to figure out your own bottom line results. There were also different cost sharing calculations at different percentages that can be factored in, if for example, she and I were to share costs on an associate and/or a paralegal, etc.   I’ve attached this spreadsheet so you will know what she’s talking about if she mentions it.",,"-Joan Kolligian: has been referring T&E and expert work to Patricia for 28 years - about 1 client a month. Has worked together as co-counsel, as well as on opposite sides, and feels she is highly intelligent and skilled. Her clients report very positively on their experience.

This was back when I was having all those wonderful technical difficulties and ended buying a new computer. 
So I was going back through my files and found him. Since then, he has been client cycling, working more in Houston and upping his rate to between $3 - $450 an hour – which makes him at least viable for our platform. He generates between $7 - $800 a year. His base comp is $200K and he gets 25% of originations for anything over $500K. His clients are 100% his as they came with him from his solo practice. Because of that and the contrast with Regional Law, this guy REALLY gets it! Additionally, he might help us with the dozens of Houston attorneys who are waiting for someone else to open before they’re go active. 
He just went to Chamberlain Hrdlicka in May and was concerned on two fronts i.e. that it might make him look flaky to clients and that you wouldn’t be open to considering him. I told him I’ve been down this road before. On the client side, it actually looks better to move a few months later, than a year or so later.

1) Michael said his biggest client is Metropolitan Equity Partners and that it was conflicted out of Zuber. However, when MBM called Paul Lisiak (Metropolitan's Managing Partner), Paul said he would consider Rimon and that he did not give the work to Zuber ""because he did not mesh with the attorneys there."" Why the contradiction? Also, did not sound at all certain that work would come to Rimon - just that they would consider it and give us a chance to pitch.

2) References gave him a back-handed compliment saying he is very honest and that he stands for what he believes in. It sounded a bit back-handed because it sounded like he is pushy about it.

3) Some of our attorneys noted that he seems uncomfortable with the virtual model, even though he comes form one. He mentioned something about our ""small office"" in Boston according to Lisa. What does he actually expect to receive from Rimon?

4) How come he has never brought in any litigation for himself?",,"1) JONATHAN KORTMANSKY and 2) MITCHELL STEIN (both Partners at Sullivan & Worcester) - hired Michael Granne for the Madoff case. Both highly recommend him for his legal and interpersonal skills. Like him so much that they rehired him when he came back. Both said he is extremely honest and stands up for what he believes in. They also believe he knows how to develop business. No hesitation from either of them.


3) PAUL LISIAK, Managing Partner, Metropolitan Equity Partners - known each other for 20 years, and very close. Has hired him for his firm to consult on litigation issues. Says his work product is excellent, he is quite sociable, and that he is extremely trustworthy.","Has represented foreign sovereigns and multinationals in a variety of disputes in U.S. courts, ranging from securities claims to breach of contract to enforcement of judicial and arbitral judgments, often involving Portuguese or Italian.

His data is in some sort of homegrown docketing system and he is not sure that his current firm will cooperate with providing the data export. At the very least, we need to make sure we understand what his transition needs will be re migrating this data to our systems. His answers to my questions like, how many lawyers on the team, what type of work, who are the clients … , were vague. I felt a bit like I was taking a depositions.

_________________________________

When he had his own firm, Jeff was making $500k-$600k a year and other partners were making about $300k. Now he makes $800k a year based on following formula: 30% of what he personally bills is his (whether or not collected), plus origination credit of 10%-25% (ramps up from 10%-25%). He believes he is getting paid too much and that enough money is not invested in support staff, so he is skeptical that 70% could go to billing professionals - though he may not realize paralegal billing is from the 70%. We can likely go in with a lower percentage here - he expects about 60%.

But not to pursue an affiliation of the firms.  
Possiby: what Bari Zahn was describing to me recently as Shang’s understanding, was a misunderstanding of the Rimon structure, economic and compensation model. A better grasp of how we work and can work could well help both parties evaluate the opportunity more constructively.
That said, my own assessment of the opportunity has changed toward the negative since we began discussions with Dai Associates.  Although the compensation model of the two firms is similar, the values and objectives of the two firms may not be aligned.  The lawyers in Dai Associates are not uniformly first tier, and if we did find a way to affiliate, I would personally be advocating that more than a few of the Dai Associates lawyers be excused from the table prior to the transaction.  Shang Dai himself is a strong personality and has his own agenda, and it is not centered entirely on his law firm.
According to implications from Bari, Shang’s management style may be more authoritarian, less sensitive, and not entirely consistent with the evolved staff and professional management practiced at Rimon.  The China connection is exciting, and could provide work for other Rimon Lawyers; but Chinese clients present significant fee payment risk issues that are well known in our profession.  And after months of interviewing them very directly, I have concluded that our own Rimon China practice lawyers do not even believe that they need each other, let alone that they would profit from a relationship with Chinese practice lawyers whom they do not know.",,,,,See Notes,,Corporate;International;International Tax;Litigation;Patent Counseling and Prosecution;Real Estate,Compensation Structure;Opportunity to be on cutting edge;People in the firm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He seemed very eager to develop work, very active marketing, etc. In the end of the day, however, it seemed like one of is clients had cooled so was raising little revenue and at same time kept on getting conflicted out of the new clients he was trying to bring in so mutually felt that it wasn't a good marriage. No insight into why he went out on his own rather than joining another shop. OTherwise though, he likes Joe and has no indications that anything bad happened to warrant his departure. Bottom line is that we have reason to be skeptical of his book, particularly since he just left a firm, is on his own, and planning to join a new firm very soon.",,"1.

From a technical standpoint, he's had a lot of experience, done a lot of depo prep, etc. for a person of his experience. Ranks him very highly technically. Diligent and reliable.

Known him for many years. From his dealings with him, he's very competent, very ambitious, can hold a conversation of a very high level, particularly for someone of his age. Holds himself very well. Very highly regarded by UTC, and was selected counsel of UTC even as an associate, which is unusual. He did acknowledge that for his company, Chubb, it's hard to get on the preferred panel of lawyer. They've been trying to shrink the number of firms they work with, not grow them. So while he'd go to bad, it would be a joint discussion and decision. (So no promises of any business). Finds Paul to be straight down the middle- open, honest, loyal. Keeps client fully in the loop, respects his client, and people around him.

I apologize for the delay.  In the mix of events, a very close family member received a very negative biopsy report that disrupted my time and triggered a flight back to my Houston home.
 
As to business, I ran into a speed bump that I am working through.   The client is a very bright, accomplished and sophisticated developer.  Since my business plan, he has added another project.  Both projects are Florida condominium developments with a gross sell out of $250M.  He was not comfortable with the Rimon condo doc experience as it relates to Florida-centric issues.  My solution was to offer to secure that requisite skill set.  He is open to that idea.
 
In keeping with your “recruitment” comment,  have two candidates in mind and have discussed it with each of them.  I hope to have this solved by the end of the week.","Tom White, John Mussman, Miami team","1) Luke Botica - client of 30 years, CPA, KPMG retired  - strong reference. We focused on Tom's business acumen - for which he has the highest regard; ethical conduct - also of the highest caliber; and how realistic his prospects are. Luke is intimately familiar with Tom's business plans, and believes the goals stated therein to be exceedingly reasonable and conservative.
2) Steve Hoeft - Partner, McDermott, Will & Emery, LLP  (also long standing friend & college roommate, occasional co-counsel; referred clients to one another) - Trusts tom as an honest and ethical person. Has never in all the time they've known one another given any reason to question his integrity or ethics. He's not very able to comment on technical skills as they've not worked together directly on a project and they are in different practice areas, but they've shared analyses with each other and his logic seems solid. Overall a positive reference from a longtime friend.
3) David Hirschfeld - former partner and co-investor in Florida real estate project. Worked on a couple of projects together. Tom found the deal, brought them in. They worked together as co-development partners. Also had another project they were going to develop, which tanked. Tom did all the legal work on both matters. Very thorough and detail oriented. Low-key, soft-spoken. Very strong from a transactional standpoint - high grades. Can only say good thing about his as a partner as well. in one project, the RE market completely collapsed, difficult time, so Tom's integrity was tested - in that case, Tom did everything he said he was going to do. Very hard time, emotionally, monetarily, but he came out as a real standup person.

I am less interested in Michael now than I was then. It makes sense that as he has more business the admin burden would limit him. But the key for me is the word commercial. Not tech, not business, not up, but down market. ""Consigliere"" is also the wrong direction for our target market.  And his rates are a tell. How is he going to make money using the  rest of us with our higher rates, with clients who want to pay only $350 ?  No wonder they like him.

His alternative was going solo, so I think having some of the support of  tax, employment, securities, etc. at Rimon would be valuable to him.   But I think he will have to market his straight O&G expertise outside of Rimon. While he writes and speaks, etc. he has not picked up clients through those avenues.  I did not get the sense that he really has fire in his bely to get out there and market and I let him know that his marketing efforts would be on his dime.  Even without really knowing a whole lot about the O&G sector, I didn’t think he had a strong plan as to how he would expand his practice.  I know more about the petrochemical and alternative energy sectors and marketing isn’t always easy.  Much of the information I was able to obtain was through direct questions.  I think we should continue talking with him through other attorneys to get a better sense as to whether he would be a good fit.  I am a bit on the fence.  Given the agonizingly slow pace of my DFI deals this past year as sometimes happens with a DFI finance practice, I need to do a ton of marketing starting now and get out there.  Fortunately, I had the resources to ride it out.  He understands that even with an established practice you really have to be aggressive.  He did not strike super aggressive but I could be wrong.

INITIAL THOUGHTS FROM BUZ 07/24/17:
If he really has ten companies that give him work, his experience both transactionally and in litigation could be a sustainable and lucrative fit.  He is admitted in a lot of places, which our litigators might like. And he has prosecutorial as well as defense experience.  On energy, he would be taken seriously in oil and gas where I would not.  That business is not going away. I would welcome that credibility, even though (or perhaps more so because) it is not in Texas.  His clientele and references would be my principal focus, but it sounds like an easy transition..  Otherwise he looks like me (only younger and with better teeth) when I was thinking about going solo for the same reasons, the same disappointments, and then I found Rimon. Yes I think we should be interested, and I think if he really is a business developer, whatever his book in energy, it will grow at Rimon.",,,small to mid-sized companies that turn to Jack as their outside general counsel; about ten clients give him regular work along with others giving work from time to time.,None,,,Federal Tax;Litigation;Real Estate,Flexibility in billing;Collaboration model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She feels strongly about bringing along a secretary/paralegal with whom she has worked at R&W and who supports her practice.  Figuring out an arrangement with Rimon to allow that to happen is important to her.  She is concerned about whether Rimon will be able to store her physical files, quickly process mail and other documents that may be sent to her at the Rimon office, and address other such administrative issues.  She is uncertain whether the value she would get from being part of Rimon would justify the 30% that Rimon would take from her collections.  She is concerned about whether Rimon has a sufficiently well-developed litigation infrastructure, such as a calendaring system and paralegal/secretary support for emergency and late-night filings.""",,,"Companies and individuals, collected over years, (including those based on heavy community outreach)",Other: see notes section,,200000.0,International Tax;Real Estate;Startups;Technology;Estate and Gift Tax,People in the firm;Flexibility in billing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From Emma Larson:

We did speak this morning at some length, I confess I am on the fence.  From my very new perspective, it seems like you have some top shelf talent on the litigation bench and John doesn’t necessarily fit that profile.  I think he has a few challenges that are under his control – he has to convince himself/figure out whether he can make his practice work on the Rimon platform (I don’t think he is quite there yet, needs to do some more legwork) and he has to see the value offered in exchange for giving up 30% of what he is able to collect (he doesn’t seem quite there yet either).  That being said, if he can get there and the goal is to build up the litigation group in the NY area in a more general sense, he could be a solid pick.  I don’t think our practice areas would overlap, but I also don’t think he poses a conflicts risk.

From Jill Penwarden:

A concern I have is that he has never tried a case so he would need help if one of his cases was going to go to trial.  I’m not sure how that might work (I’m sure our Cal litigators might be able to help out in the background, but not appear in court in NY).  Seems that his cases never go to trial so maybe this would never be an actual problem.

From MBM:

- Worked as a claims consultant. John was the lawyer recommended to him about 8 years ago in connection with his biggest client - AirServ/ABM. Very smooth relationship. One of the few attorneys who really took the time to learn the business, the anatomy of different types of claims, got to know management. Sees big picture and of the highest integrity.

Don Weinberg was supervising partner for John back when John was an associate. They didn't work in the same office, but Don gives him high marks. Thought he was toward the top of the heap. High integrity, excellent technical skills. He wouldn't hesitate to hire him himself.  

Jeremy Hager - Known for 15 years, originally as co-defendant. Knows personally at this point too. Excellent technical skills, knowledgeable, gets good results, has gotten out of cases where Jeremy was stuck, seen at many depositions in co-defendant role. Relaxed style, not bombastic. No qualifications.

""I am looking for a law-firm platform to support my pursuit of this $400mm to $500mm class action, over the next two to four years, in exchange for part of the potential attorneys’ fee award (which might run between $80mm and $120mm).  Litigation finance firms are generally not interested in tax cases, which they view as a complex specialty.  Accordingly, I am looking for a law firm that essentially is willing to “make a bet” on the case, which involves so much money that the risk/reward calculation for a law firm might be very intriguing.
 
As to that calculation, the case I recently filed is unusual because the expenses, aside from my salary, are virtually zero.  There will be no discovery nor expert witness testimony needed -- I know this because I have litigated similar individual cases against DOJ.  The class-notification expenses for this class of 285 teaching hospitals are negligible; the IRS already in its records the identifies of the 285 corporate, nonprofit taxpayers involved.  I can’t imagine that a class won’t be certified:  the IRS chose the wrong interest rate for refunds paid to these taxpayers, which participated in a global concession announced in 2010.  Essentially, the IRS intentionally clicked the wrong button on its interest-computation program.  I am the only attorney in the nation who has handled this type of suit, I invented the argument for recovery, and I am very experienced with suits against the IRS, both in the federal trial courts and in the federal courts of appeals.  I see no realistic possibility that I won’t be appointed class counsel.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She is actually in NY and I don’t have any trips planned to NY right now.  It may have been better to meet her in person but I found her to be completely flat and difficult to draw out.  It seemed that her only interest in Rimon was her ability to work from home.  She was not very expansive on her clients, the types of deals she does, etc.  She said she could keep a partner and a couple associates busy and would possibly bring an associate.  In terms of returning to Akin she mentioned that the practice she was in is not doing well and she needed the flexibility to work from home.  Could not get much information on cross selling.  Michael, it might just be me and she should maybe speak with someone like Juan or Jill to draw her out a bit more or take a closer look at her questionnaire but I was not able to draw her out as to her practice or her other interests.  Let me know if you would like me to give it another run.  In terms of timing she would like to move this month.  I was really disappointed as I would really like to do more cross selling in the firm and she would have been a logical person.

I didn’t get anything from the call and so would lean on negative as usually I can get a conversation going and asked several questions which were answered without much elaboration.  In terms of her resume, she has worked with good firms and says that her book was generated there, but again I don’t have much on the details other than the 4 clients are in project construction and renewable energy.  Asked about the types and size of the deals but did not get much beyond wind and a solar deal and the sizes are roughly $100MM.  They are all domestic though one of her clients has done projects in emerging markets.

He will also need a bridge loan of approx $30k-$40k for first two months, but can get a retainer from client to serve as collateral.

If we do that, I would suggest 50% or something as I do not think that would be the deciding factor.

NOTES FROM DENNIS RAGLIN:
I knew him only in passing and do not know anything about his business.  My understanding was he had been partner and was then changed to contract partner a few years back when he lost a client or some business.  I do not know the specifics and whether things improved if so.

He was always perfectly pleasant and nice to me in our exchanges and we had various conversations over the years.  A couple of people found him a bit of an odd duck but I think perhaps that was just an extreme dry wit at times.  He also might just be shy and a bit awkward.  Did not know or work with him enough to know.  I remember one associate worked for him and claimed a negative experience in terms of management style, but I do not have enough facts to be able to support that as my own opinion.",,,Represents insurance companies against hospitals,,About one full time associate,,,Lack of Bureaucracy;Approach to legal conflicts and business conflicts;Collaboration model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""She requires and consumes significant human resources, in part because she worked 100% from home and relied on those in the office for various needs a lot of secretarial support and Rimon’s current set up of too many lawyers to a secretary in my opinion will present a problem for her (it is presenting a challenge for me).  She has always required an associate and I cannot see her relying on contract lawyers; I suspect she would need one dedicated in whole or 50% at a minimum to her.   She is also a unique personality and this can rub some the wrong way, including many in the Prop 65 bar, and I can discuss that with you by phone.

Met through head of family office associate. Brought paul onto matter. Worked together extensively for 5 months in this year. Good technical chops, good soft skills, becomes a key adviser. non-judgmental, collaborative. Honest. Note that he can be very direct (but diplomatic) so you'll know exactly where he stands. He doesn't do well with ungrateful or entitled folks - never rude, but he's experienced enough that he doesn't want to waste time with high maintenance, low reward situations. 
2) Bruce DeBoskey - “Philanthropic advisor to ultra-affluent families,” work associates  - know through a professional group, 3 to 4 years ago. Roy referred him a client from NY. Got involved together with AFHI - spoke together. Lectured together at Pepperdine. No ability to assess technical skills (Bruce is not a T&E guy). But can opine that he's incredibly smart, excellent writer, skilled presenter, client loves him, the most thoughtful lawyer that he's seen in this space. Thinks that he has the highest standards. 
3) Paul Sowell - Former employee and associate. Roy had T&E boutique, joined in 2000. Became partner 2007. Merged into Smith Gambrell. There together 8 years. then joined WF. Continued . . 
4) Scott Harty - Former partner at Smith Gambrell and Russell - 2010-2015. Worked closely together. Thinks he's a fabulous marketer, clients seem to really enjoy him. Mostly, they were Roy's clients. He's always felt that there's more than enough good clients that you don't have to take bad clients. He got along well with associates. He clashed a bit with other T&E partners because he had a more forward looking view of the practice (didn't want to spend time on $5 million ""commodity"" estates). So perhaps came across as a little ""judgmental"" on the subject. But he agrees with Roy on this subject. Thinks he's caring, giving, of good character.

Tom stresses that Jim is dedicated in all circumstances: “works tirelessly, day-and-night” to get any/every job done, and is efficient. He makes strong recommendation for Jim, in wrap-up says that Jim is very smart, honest, fair in billing, and generally is great to work with.

#2 Tom Ahto: (Manager/colleague/Client) Worked together on different levels since the 80’s. Tom was Jim’s manager at Heller, colleague at Comdisco, then a client when Tom was at BofA. Tom notes that Jim has very broad financial law background. And he is very intelligent regarding all areas of finance, “remarkably so, a very quick and great mind.” Similarly Tom reports that Jim works tirelessly and is competent. He also notes that Jim is very easy to work with, always listens, considers what others have to say, considers options; but also “knows how to hold his position, he is honest and straightforward.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He seems to hog the work and do everything, even though I can't see how he would be expert in everything. When offered opportunities to say he cross-sells to specialists, he fumbled and said it makes more financial sense for him to do it himself. He seems to lack sophistication. However, it could just be that his practice is an outside GC role that does not require expertise. I would like to see an LCQ or business plan.

Vince’s arrangement with Greenspoon is 66/33 split and he started with a draw of 320K which has been dropped to 280K.  GM’s year ends on Nov. 30th.  Vincent says that he has some clients paying in 90 day cycles.  Any revenues he receives after December 31st will not be credited until 2018 and then there will be additional monies withheld.  It also means that he will not receive a firm bonus for 2017.  
Vincent’s receivables run conservatively $70K monthly.  There is another $10,000K that is thrown at him from the firm.  He keeps a paralegal busy full time.  He bills her out at $160 per hour and with her billing 2,000 hours generates another $320K in revenue (she makes $70,000).    At Rimon, he estimates that he can pay an associate $100-120,000 and bill him out at a high enough rate to make a profit.  Vincent desperately needs to bring in a real estate associate. 
As for hourly rates, GM advertises $450 an hour as an A rate.  $400 is standard.  The average rate is $370 an hour and Vincent has some work at $330.",,,Among a mix of clients:  Beazer Homes; Craig Gunther (computer software); and a 20 million dollar litigation dispute.,Paralegal,About one full time associate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He has hopped around quite a bit, and there are no guarantees that he won’t do so again after joining Rimon.   However, from my conversation, he was happiest when he launched his own Chinese firm (Fen Xun), and unhappiest at traditional law firm setting. In my mind, that would actually make him more likely to excel or at least find a place at Rimon.  He wants to be his own boss but have the benefits of being at a firm where he isn’t the only possible source of work (and where there are other experts he can draw on).   So I am not concerned as much about the issue you outlined.",Received,No,Received,Yes,No,Compliance;Corporate and Business Transactions;Financial Services;International,Joined Rimon,"Chapman, Jim;Diamond, Mark;Larson, Emma;Liu, Zheng (Jen);Moradzadeh, Michael;Qin, Letao;Terry, Christopher",zcrm_1837424000002109035,"Open questions:
- admitted in Hong Kong? Would prefer to be in Hong Kong or Shenzhen?

Collections were as low as $800k to as high as $2m, but mostly around $1m. Almost all of that was billed by him personally and would have been generated regardless of firm.

More on reference calls:

- Jamie Barr: when pushed, he admitted that Fred can be intellectually intimidating and that in Asia, there are a lot of mediocre lawyers that could be intimidated by Fred, and there may be a personality clash if Fred does not respect someone intellectually. On the other hand, Fred gets along very well with other intellectuals. ""Invest time in integrating him properly. Make an effort with him and he will make an effort with them. But I don't see this as an issue.""
   -- as a side note, Jamie now coaches management and he HIGHLY recommends giving new hires the Myers Briggs test to help with integration, and the attorneys own self-assessment. Encourage attorneys to share their results with everyone else. In fact, could be a good icebreaker for firm to take it and share results with each other. ""Everyone but law firms is doing this now.""
   -- another side note: he may want to join Rimon. I will explore.","Welcome by Zheng, Jim, Emma, and Chris Terry","#1: Reference from Bingham: our own Jim Chapman: I know Fred well and enjoyed working with him. I know he hated Bingham/Morgan Lewis and both he and I were unhappy regarding how Morgan Lewis management dealt with the Beijing office where Fred worked.  Late last year he joined a Japanese bank as in-house counsel.

#2: Jamie Barr was head of Asia corporate at Lovells for ten years: Fred's practice is very sophisticated, high-end finance that included Morgan Stanley and Deutsche. He left because the financial crisis hit in 2008, making the entire practice area struggle. Fred saw this as the right time to go to the Chinese firm (Jamie thinks that was ""an astute move"" to allow him to get into the China market.) Fred is an intellectual/cerebral man. Fred collaborates with his partners. Jamie was disappointed when Fred decided to leave but understands why he did it. He would definitely hire Fred again.

#3: Chris Chan was a senior banker at SMBC and is now a senior advisor - Worked for a long time together at Deutsche, at the time, he was the head of country and Fred was chief counsel. Then joined SMBC. On a technical level - very sound, business mind. Very solution minded. Re honesty: Thinks he is quite a righteous man, high integrity. At SMBC - didn't stay very long because of, as Chris says - a ""difference of mentality in working for the Japanese"". His honest belief was that it was a cultural mismatch. Fred wants to show that he can bring change, improvements, etc, etc. and this firm was not open to change, but they also didn't communicate that until the day he was let go. At Deutsche, he was well liked, and he's unable to comment on the changes of firm in Beijing. 

#4: Zhao Ying was a partner at FenXun - was associate at White and Case and Hogan with Fred, then a partner at FenXun. He thinks very highly of Fred, both based on technical skills and integrity. Thinks that cultural with with American firms will be much better with an Japanese/Chinese firms.

Peng is very technically strong with a great scientific background that allows him to understand very subtle differences in biology. Peng is one of best lawyers in San Diego. Peng works very well in a team, including in a litigation team that made a ""dream team"". Charges have been fair and honest, without any issues. Will bring business to Rimon if Peng joins.

2)	Dr. Xiaobo Wang is CTO & VP of Acea Biosciences (client since 1999) - Peng is only patent lawyer they work with for large matters, but MoFo's prices are too high for them to use Peng for smaller projects. Peng is excellent at patent procurement, prosection, and strategy all over the world. He is very very thorough. ""His ability to understand details of technology is really rare."" He has worked with Peng in a team with six other lawyers and saw Peng working very well in the team. Would bring their work to Rimon with Peng, and probably more due to pricing flexibility.

As between FB and Rimon, it sounds like he is more comfortable with us, although he doesn’t seem negative about FB either.

Jim’s primary clients seem to be a mix of about half a dozen family office-type clients who call on him for a mix of litigation, real estate and other transactional matters. From what I could tell he was brought in to Baker Hostetler primarily to service Madoff-related litigation, which has by now pretty much stopped. He also handles some chapter 11 and receivership matters, which I assume he and Paul Jasper discussed in more detail.

When he described some of his client relationships, I did think there should be some opportunities that Rimon could try to capitalize on. As examples, (i) one of his clients acquired patents and other IP in an Israeli insolvency, so there may be some things that Dror Futter or others might be able to help him with; and (ii) he also has a client that is looking at opportunities involving receivable trading where I could likely assist. There may be others.

Jim’s greatest concern about a move is he does not want to be “siloed” but rather very much wants to join a truly collaborative team. I also think he would want opportunities for inbound work as well. I would suspect he might be able to handle some East Coast litigation matters for some of our West Coast colleagues, for example Lillian Stenfeldt among others, but I don’t have a good sense of what these needs may be.

I think Jim would be a good colleague and would embrace our firm culture. Based on his questions, he is very focused on being part of a truly collaborative team rather than just one guy on his own. My biggest question would be whether he is comfortable with having to rely, primarily, on his own clients.",,"1) Marc Hirschfield - Partner, Roy Cooper Cohen Braunfeld LLC: Thinks highly of Jim. Jim started as an associate under Marc. Good quality of work. Strong technically. Interpersonally, has somewhat of a military mindset in terms of hierarchy - great respect for higher ups, but demands the same of support folks. He was a star golfer at the Marine Academy, and has a great deal of contacts through the military/golf circuit. He sees himself as a business developer. Historically has been a Bankr. attorney but ""grew up"" in the slow period for bankruptcy and has gone where there work is. Believes that he has great capacity to develop business. 

2) Sam Berg - Client, Owner of S2 Estates- RE business in NYC, Jim was recommended. Advised on litigious situation with investors. Also acted on a few RE transactional matters/GC matters over 12-18 month matter. Found him approachable, professional, easy to get along with, responsive. Was very happy with results. Never questioned his integrity.
 
3) Ali Kelly - Counsel at Commvault - supervised Jim at Viston and Elkins. Confirmed that entire department left firm because their bankruptcy practice was decimated at the time. Said Jim has a wonderful personality, is detail oriented and hard working. Jim has many high-level contacts that can be turned into clients. He is also very honest and dependable.","Examples:

Due Diligence Stage,"MBM asked why book has declined in last three years. Here is his answer:

""... it is one of the primary reasons I am interested in moving to a platform like Rimon.
 
            At our peak, we were four full-time attorneys and a paralegal.  When the economy last crashed, and companies at our end of the market were unable to obtain credit or equity financing, the transactions which are our bread and butter dwindled down to practically none, and we were required to downsize.  Today, we are two attorneys and a paralegal, so we have lost half of the billing power that we once had.  In addition, the downsize caused me to have to devote much more time to client work, which has significantly curtailed the amount of business development I have been able to do.  We also experienced some failed transactions in 2016, which affected our receivables.  We are picking some of it back up through collections efforts, but it had an impact.
 
            In 2015, we did pick up a huge transaction for the firm, which was the sale of Triple H Food Processors to a private equity fund, and that generated a lot of revenue for the Firm.  In 2016 and 2017, we did not have any single transactions that were as large, and so revenue dipped.  Also, we had anticipated a wave of M&A activity from Chinese clients, but the currency restrictions imposed by China in the last half of the year caused that not to materialize.
 
            For 2018, we currently have several good transactions in the pipeline which should make Q1-Q2 more profitable for us than these periods in prior years.  These include a reverse merger for one of our technology clients into a public company (following which we will also handle the public reporting), and two private placements of equity for clients that are in positive revenue.  The SEC work can be very lucrative and is ongoing quarterly and annual reporting.  We view the increase in the level of public company transactions as a good sign for our business as well.
 
            My interest in Rimon, then, is to allow me personally to utilize other attorneys more to handle the work that I bring in, and allow me to focus more on doing business development.  I also feel that being part of the organization will allow me to work with larger and more stable clients, as opposed to the typically very small or pre-revenue startup clients that we have drawn from historically, which will have an impact on both the amount of work we handle and the collectability of the A/Rs it produces.",Sent,No,LCQ Received,No,No,Corporate and Business Transactions;International;Mergers & Acquisitions;Securities,Book was not high enough,"Moradzadeh, Michael;Thomas, Ted;Zuniga, Juan",zcrm_1837424000000110019,"Work has been done by Ken, an associate, a paralegal and contract lawyers.

Reference was glowing but lacked any specifics and he did not seem to really have experience with his litigation skills - just knowledge of his reputation.

Understands that he would have to pay for his own secretary. Also understands that we would charge him for an office - though not sure how that would play out if we have others that don't pay. MBM did tell him that we were going to provide ""group of three lawyers"" (Fawer's group) offices, ""because, frankly, the finances work out that way.""

Wants to practice for another five years (when he turns 80). Is clearly extremely sharp and knew more about Rimon in preparation for our first call than almost anyone I have spoken to. At end of initial call he seemed surprised that we do not have a NY office. He told him that our model was built on that and wanted to make sure he was comfortable with that. He insisted that he was - but it did not seem so clear in his tone.

Lex Machina subscription costs $20k per year - highly advises that we get one.

Told Matt Poppe he uses a dictaphone. MBM discussed this with him at lunch - he is willing to have a secretary's pay come directly from his 70% for this.","Peng Chen, NY lunch","1.	Alexandra Gracik - President, SABIKA, client for 5 years- he was very responsive, direct, and intelligent. Got the result they wanted.

2.	Damien Dernoncourt - former President of John Hardy Jewelers, client - Met in 2003, and worked together for 12 years.. Was CEO of company before buying company. Mac handled all the IP strategy and enforcement work for the company. Mac switched firms 2 or 3 times in this period. Damien always followed him. Mac is great at high level strategy and nuts and bolts. Great at mentoring client, always understood the business, fair billing. Very honest as well, (told story of where Mac clearly put client's interests ahead of his own). No reservations in recommending.

3.	Dr. Charles Miller – Partners at Eaton for last couple years and friends for 50 years. ""If I had two words to describe him it would be 'excellent man'."" He is ""highly intelligent and an excellent litigator."" Has a great reputation, particularly for trials and arbitration.

I have some reservations that she would be a good fit – at least in the short/medium term.  The market for Chinese reverse listings is dead and has been for some time (she acknowledged the same on her call).  Further, its not an area I would recommend getting into even if it heats up again as those transactions are basically recipes for lawsuits and securities law violations.  As well all know, an M&A practice is hit or miss and not really something that can be built from scratch in a short time period .So I am not sure what sort of business she could build, which suggests it may not be the right time for her to join Rimon.",,No,Not Yet Sent,No,No,Corporate;International;Mergers & Acquisitions,Book was not high enough;Level of excellence was lacking,"Moradzadeh, Michael;Terry, Christopher",zcrm_1837424000000930049,"Bills out at $425/hr.

David was able to bring in an internal investigation matter to his team due to his expertise and ability to impress client. In fact, he is certain that client will follow David and word of mouth will direct more clients to David. David is very efficient. David's practice was growing, but LeClaire just had a horrible year causing ""draconian steps"" where attorneys being paid more than they brought in were asked to leave -- many were like situated. He will really miss David.

(2)	Rick O'Connor - Client -- David was the lead attorney on a compliance matter for over four months. Quality of work was excellent. ""What impressed me most was meticulousness and communication on matter."" Billing was fair and efficient. Wouldn't hesitate to bring him on to a future matter if the opportunity presents itself.

(3)	William Stapleton - Works at state IG. Know one another through Steve Linuk (IG at state department). Steve and Bill both used to work with DOJ, then Steve was IG of FHFA. And David was there too - they overlapped for 10 months. Smart, fast, extremely hard working.

From Julie the recruiter:

1. She cares about a title (even if it doesn’t mean much internally). Managing Partner or Head of West Coast________ etc

2. Transparency - she’s been at firms that have been very secretive to her detriment 

3. Flowers - send flowers to her house on behalf of the firm

4. Be responsive. If you can strike a deal first, you’ll land them. 

5. Take her to dinner to celebrate and talk about her future at Rimon. 

Try to spend a little more time w the others if you can: dinner, lunch, drinks. Group or 1:1 or2:1

Admin team: Aaron (paralegal/project manager) and Kaley (patent paralegal/docketing clerk), plus Lisa (lit secretary). They each make about $70k a year.

Associates make $250k a year

Karineh is like an abused spouse. She feels like she was treated very well and then everything changed. She is scared of that happening again. She wants equity in order to call herself an equity partner and she wants safegaurds that give her say/insight into the firm. She also wants a title for marketing purposes. Amir is concerned about lack of cash flow the first few months - so they will propose something where we might invest more in the beginning in return for something from there (maybe a higher percentage).

""I recalled my specific concerns about Newbold and thought I would give you the reasons why I would not recommend taking him on and hoping he would grow into the position,  It has been about 12 years or more since I was at Hopkins & Carley and longer than that when Dan first applied. At that time, I reviewed his writing sample.  I was not a good writing sample, but the worst part was that it was very sloppy and replete with errors. It was one or the worst presentations I have ever seen in connection with a legal job interview.  I was not inclined to make him an offer, but Jim Quillinan wanted to give him a chance.  Needless to say, He was really no better on the job.  I recall that his work product was sub-par.  This is not to say that he cannot function as a lawyer.  It is just that his skill set is nowhere what you need.  I hope he has improved since then, but I would have to be convinced.",,,,,10 to 20 hours a week,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DVTi - clear, per Justin Z 10/25",D. Due Diligence Stage,"More notes on Client Billing, per recruit, 9/28/18:
My portables estimate includes both client and matter originations that I am confident will remain with me. 

The firm’s “billing attorney” label is a bit misleading. It identifies who has responsibility for sending bills. I’m billing attorney for other partners’ originated clients, usually because I manage work distribution or have increased the client relationship. I’ve also brought in new clients and have someone else handle billing, because I’m not doing any of the work (e.g., new business succession client, new start-ups needing early corporate support) and don’t want the administrative duty.  

Niagara number is accurate. Patent litigation in EDVa, hotly contested, but likely settling. This is another client that I did not originate, as they were an existing land use/leasing client, but I brought in the litigation. Niagara has explicitly stated that they hired me for the litigation, and want to continue working with me for other IP projects. 

New client collections, not including matter originations, such as the licensing work I brought in from an existing immigration client, or the patent work I brought in from a corporate client:
•	2016 - $75,753
•	2017 - $157,782
•	2018 (through Aug) - $138,344
These numbers are limited to collections from new clients for which the system identifies me as client originating attorney. This does not include jointly-originated clients or new patent litigation matters for which I share origination credit - two categories I consider important in assessing portable business. The Niagara matter is a good example. The client originating and billing attorney helped them secure a land lease a few years back. I saw they were listed as a patent infringement defendant, and pursued/won the representation. They consider themselves my client. Similar situation for large patent portfolio and licensing matters.",,No,LCQ Received,No,No,Intellectual Property Litigation;Patent Counseling and Prosecution,Other,"Kaufman, Marc;Moradzadeh, Michael;Quatrini, Phillip;Waldbaum, Maxim",zcrm_1837424000000946201,"He charges $420/hour, which he could raise without impact. His firm set his rate.

For 2018, as of 7/31/18, he has billed 2200 hours and has had $500K cash personal receipts, plus an additional $200K receipts on billings. 

In 2017, he had $720K in personal receipts as the working attorney plus an additional $300K, which he billed for other attorneys, plus an additional $500K of other originations billed and collected.

In 2016, he had under $670K, which would have been higher, but the firm required a major write-off, plus an additional $131K which he billed for other attorneys, plus an additional $450K originations. 

From February 2018 to now, he has billed $500K/month for a major patent case, which is ending shortly.

Also note:
Collected from clients that I independently introduced:
•	2016 - $75,753
•	2017 - $157,782
•	2018 (through Aug) - $138,344
Collected from clients that I jointly introduced:
•	2016 - $130,079
•	2017 - $314,425
•	2018 (through Aug) - $284,296

The client origination history isn’t a very useful metric for gauging portables. It shows only a small fraction of what follows me. It includes the clients I’ve introduced to WM on my own, but we pitch and market in teams and joint origination is common. Some senior partners are compensated on client origination, and I am compensated on working collections and matter origination. It works better to assign senior partners client origination credit, and then because I’m managing the client’s work, I control matter origination credit. I delegate to associates who need billable hours, and often I share matter credit with senior associates as an incentive. As an example, a senior partner and I pitched a SaaS company. He did one immigration project for them, and I grew that relationship to handle all of their software licensing and contract work. He",,"1.	Craig Mytelka, senior Partner and colleague

Knows Bill Kircher well, with almost daily interaction: Bill is resistant to making the change - 81 years old and likes where he is for now.

Talking points, according to recruiter: 
•	Flexibility of work from any location including Montana
•	Retirement package or reduced hours of work. I believe (not sure) that his current comp is in the range of $300K. If his book is truly $2M+ he makes $400K just for bringing the business to your firm and not billing any hours. Now if he bills say 10 hours per week (2 hours per day) at an average of $400 / hour, that is another 50% x $400 x 500 hours or $100K which makes his total comp around $500K per year. 
I had already explained different scenarios including the above in the proposal I sent him. So if he can make more, have flexibility and take whomever he wants and work with his ex-colleague (Patrick) and possibly another senior trial attorney (John), I think it is a no brainer.",,,"Tech, oil, gaming",,,,,People in the firm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I told him about the possibility of John Passarelli joining your firm (didn't disclose his name but told him he was in mid-west and willing to move to CA). I told him he is experienced and could potentially team up with him to present in front of big clients for antitrust cases. I think with John Passarelli, Bob Freitas, and Bill Kircher, we will have potentially good critical mass to make this happen (they are all kind of related and help each other out).

Notes from Karineh 11/06/18:
Bob was a well respected lawyer from Orrick.  He spun out from Orrick and did IP litigation defense work. From what I understand, there was a disagreement among the partners, they had fallen on hard times, and there may have been an arbitration or some other legal action involved.  Bob then created his second firm where he did mostly Plaintiff’s NPE work. Based on what I know,  I don’t think that he has $5million in business.  If this is a serious candidate, I would vet his conflicts very carefully.  Any NPE he or his firm has represented in the past would be imputed on us and would conflict us out of a ton of work (this was the DM problem, they had represented NPEs in the past or brought on candidates that had represented NPEs in the past and I was constantly conflicted out).

Matte Poppe notes on Bob Frietas 11/02/18:
One other note about Bob:  He ended up staying at Orrick a few months after he announced his decision to join Freitas Tseng in order to help out with a massive and high-profile IP case that Orrick was handling at the time (Mattel v. MGA).  His involvement somehow generated a lot of bad blood with the rest of that Orrick team (which did not include me), including because he supposedly used the opportunity to try to poach a couple of Orrick associates to join him at Freitas Tseng (and for other reasons that I'm less clear on).  So there were people I liked and respected at Orrick who hae a low opinion of Bob.

MBM: very slow and boring talker. Still not clear to me why he wants to move. He says flexibility in billing.

INITIAL noted from Mac:
1.	Can he grow his business? Not alone.He does not have a strong law firm background and his academic credentials are mediocre in the law.Obviously very intelligent and driven. 7 years at Locke lord and not made partner is a weak sign. No first chair responsibilities it seems. APOTEX is a horrible client. If we indeed represent big pharma no chance for him with his clients in RIMON. What big pharma do we represent? His knowledge of FDA regulatory is very valuable. He seems strong there.

2.Is his practice sophisticated? Doubt it - too young in the practice to tell even though he has been at it for 10 years. Not yet reached the level of sophistication we probably expect. Not his fault but he seems to have languished in the wrong choices of development. Effort and desire high but not enough to overcome the highly competitive nature of his chosen IP field.

3.Leaving because he does not haver the support a young lawyer needs to secure his maturity and sees Duane Morris as an average sluggish law firm which cannot help him. And after two years Duane Morris sees the limitations i set forth above.They see a very capable MD who shows no signs of star quality as a litigator and treated there more like a high priced technical consultant who does not support a lawyer/litigator salary. Unfortunately I know many like him, just does not fit.",,,"Major client categories:

For Liability Insurance, Outside counsel shall, at its own expense, obtain and maintain in full force and effect with sound and reputable insurers with AM Best Rating of A-X or better during the term of their engagement, the insurance coverage in sufficient amounts for Workers Compensation, Broad Form Commercial General Liability, Employer’s Liability, and Professional Liability.

Conflict:  Absent unusual circumstances, Morgan Stanley will not normally view outside counsel’s representation of a party involved in a negotiated transaction in which Morgan Stanley is also involved as a conflict that requires a waiver, assuming the other party agrees not to use the law firm if a dispute involving Morgan Stanley arises, and agrees not to object to the law firm’s continued ability to represent Morgan Stanley on other pending and future matters.

Business Continuity Planning
Outside counsel is required to maintain adequate business continuity, disaster recovery, and backup plans in order to perform its obligations hereunder with minimal disruption or delay.

There is a big divide between Jonathan and David here. Jonathan keeps focusing on the big picture, synergies, etc. He really likes the idea of bringing “in-house” a lot of the work they are currently referring away. David is enormously skeptical of giving up 30%  - in fact, he almost exclusively focuses on the large amount of money that they would have to pay over, the “large check” they’d have to pay, and he can’t just hope that they make it back. He called that a bet that he won’t be able to make, etc. etc. In terms of next steps, they are going to be sending us their P&L and we’re going to go over what Rimon covers and what we don’t. We’re going to send over our Internal Rates sheet. Jonathan also mentioned in passing that David’s book is probably a little larger than Jonathan’s, in case it’s relevant.",,,Musicians and tech start-ups in the entertainment business.,,See Notes,,Corporate;IP LItigation,Management Stucture;Lack of Bureaucracy;Collaboration model;People in the firm;Practice/Sector expertise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recruiter comments/advice:
This is a man who generates $5M and not only is he not appreciated, he’s lectured. 
I would suggest that at some point during a call, you ask about his perspective on the client development process. Then I would render a genuine compliment (and at $5M a year, it WOULD be genuine!) and then ask whether if he ended up joining Rimon, he might be willing to share his expertise with others in the firm either locally, via video or whatever. Shelton’s Axiom: Everyone feels taken for granted at some point but no one ever has the problem of feeling too appreciated. This would establish Rimon Management as the contrast to patronizing and dismissive management. 
I might also suggest a preemptive strike along the lines of “If you join Rimon, how would you feel about helping Frederick recruit, vet and build the practice?”",,No,LCQ Sent,No,No,State and Local (Subnational) Tax,,"Moradzadeh, Michael",zcrm_1837424000000110044,From Susan Klein: I noted that Rich Kariss might be continuing as a potential candidate.

•	No bank in the U.S. would open accounts for U.S. businesses that have Russian parents  
•	Extraordinarily difficult to receive payments from Russian businesses through the American banking system
•	Clients not getting paid for an extended period on products or services that were sold into Russia, concluding that it would be difficult to get paid in a timely manner for work done in the U.S. for Russian clients.

Dallas Office:
My current firm’s Dallas office is small, though we do have several talented lawyers there.  The firm has three full-time lawyers in that office, another who is moving to Tulsa and one other lawyer who is essentially part-time in hours worked.  Although my firm does want to grow the office there (main priority for growth are the office HQ in Tulsa and OKC), it is extremely hesitant to take the risk of lateral expansion, which to me is frustrating, because I expressed a desire to be down there, especially when I first came back on board at C&W in April 2017.  Before coming on board in 2017, I was told Dallas would be an option if I would agree to a formula and essentially an eat-what-you-kill arrangement.  I couldn’t do so at the time, coming from the firm I had been at which was cash-poor - I needed a stable (and better) salary at the time.  If I broached the subject again today (which I haven’t brought it back up), I’m not sure what the answer would be - although I know the preference would be to have me in the Tulsa (HQ) office.

It was expressed to me by the firm’s President (a good friend of mine) that the focus of the firm is to shore-up its main offices:  Tulsa and Oklahoma City.  It is essentially an Oklahoma-based firm; though I believe the better business is located in Texas.  And I can fully practice law and represent my Oklahoma-based clients wherever my office is, including in Dallas.",,No,LCQ Sent,No,No,Commercial Litigation;Corporate and Business Transactions,Client Conflicts,"Moradzadeh, Michael",zcrm_1837424000000946201,"$385/hour is his typical hourly bill rate.

1.	He is at the whiteboard stage.  He has an idea and has done very limited testing to determine if the market is really interested in his solution.   When asked about prospective clients he’s spoken to in the blockchain space about this model, he hemmed and hawed and gave one very weak example.
2.	Don’t think he has actually marketed to the blockchain space.  Don’t think he has any sense of how few of these companies are real and will be around next year.
3.	He spoke roughly 25 out of our 30 minutes.  Not a great listener and gave long winded answers full of what he viewed as insights and which were really basic knowledge.
4.	He believes that having a firm name behind him will give him the credibility to sell this model.  I (Dror) think that his model will appeal to cost first shoppers and his background should be sufficient to allow him to sell.
5.	It is one thing to have attorneys who in certain situations accept equity, but another for whom equity is a significant source of compensation for most engagements.  I (Dror) would not like the word on the street or at least in the blockchain community to be that Rimon will work for equity.",,,High growth cryptocurrency start-ups and technology companies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1.  Case 16-O-17825.  Our firm was retained by a client to perform regulatory due diligence on a potential dispensary purchase in LA.  At the time there were no cannabis licenses in LA, just an affirmative defense from prosecution if the dispensary could meet LA's complicated municipal code requirements.  At that point, our belief was that dispensaries that could prove they met the municipal code requirements would be grandfathered and would be eligible for licenses if/when LA ultimately issued licenses (in 2018, this belief ended up being confirmed as accurate).  

Other attorneys at my office performed the due diligence review of documents and cross-checked them against the LA Municipal Code, based on that review they determined that the target dispensary was non-compliant and thus likely would not be ultimately eligible for a license.  

Separate from the due diligence review, Luke Stanton recalled the dispensary name and reviewed another client's file where he believed he had seen the name.  In his review of that other file, he noticed that one of the firm's other clients had (with a different firm representing him) previously purchased that dispensary and then sold it to a different third party (i.e., not the seller in this transaction), creating a chain of title issue on top of the non-compliance concern.

Mr. Stanton was mindful of the duty of confidentiality owed to the other client and asked that client if he could share this information to the potential buyer client to prevent him from buying a dispensary that might not be owned by the seller.  The other client told Mr. Stanton that he could tell the potential buyer client about the existence of the documents, but he was not authorized to share the purchase documents. 

Mr. Stanton provided the due diligence memorandum to the potential purchaser client and also told the potential purchaser client about the chain of title issue.  The potential purchaser c","LA lawyers, Paul Jasper, Frank and Michael Vargas, Jennifer Dasari, Jim Chapman","Justin Keller:

He’s a very typical Leclair lawyer who charges very low rates.   

I doubt the economics work.   He bills out at $300 per hour.   Some of the work is flat fee, but most is hourly.   

So for him to make this work, in my opinion, he needs really cheap timekeepers - like contract attorneys at $75 per hour or whatever.   He also needs a litigator in TX and FL to be on the pleadings - which we don’t have right now 

By way of example, he can’t pay me my internal of $250 to do this work for him in CA.  He would not make any money at all after the firm takes its 30 Percent.   And we don’t really have associate bandwith for this. 

He also needs a paralegal.  Not sure it makes financial sense for the firm to pay for that person.  

I think we should pass.  And I definitely would not pay a headhunter for him""",,,Main client is CIT for which he is the national coordinator of debt collection.,,,,,,,,,,"We passed: billing rates are very low, yet he depends on giving work to other attorneys.

Notes from Yaacov's initial call:
Personality
He was noot terribly sociable. No pleasantries at the start - not even a ""how are you/nice to meet you"", kinda waited for me to ""begin the interview"". 
He recounted an interaction that he had with IT at his company where he basically demanded a program and he was told that employees don't get to dictate what software the firm purchases. He replied (his words): ""I'm an equity partner, you work for me"". Rubbed me the wrong way a little. 
I do tend to believe his offered reasons for the malpractice, and that he may very well have been blameless. But I also see how he could be a bit arrogant and rub people the wrong way. 

That said, the rest of the conversation was fine, and there was nothing off the charts here. Those are just the negative points. 
Money

Needs:
- 2 associates - 1 left, and he'd like to replace her
- 1 paralegal

He wants an office for his team, and doesn't see a way to work without one. His estimate was that he'd need 2000 sqf (seemed like a lot) at 20-25/sqf or $40k-$50k per year.

Groups Needs, per Allen 6/20:
•	Likely need 4-8 paralegals with salaries averaging 80k depending on the size of the group of attorneys.  There is one that is an outlier at 100K that is critical to our operation.  
•	Foundation IP would be our preferred docket system - a cloud-based subscription service that charges based on the number of active files.  
•	Benefits include health, dental, disability, basic life insurance, 401k with profit sharing (no matching).  
•	RTP would have 1-2 associates at 120 and 160k.  Ann Arbor would have a patent agent at 90k.  Salt lake would have an associate at 140k.  Similar benefits.
•	1 admin in RTP @ 55K.  There are 2 in Ann Arbor @60.

Maybe Rimon can take over the lease. They can probably use just half the space.

From Eric Cohen at lunch meet 6/14 - Potential issues and questions: CONFIDENTIAL!
1.	 How will the overhead for the RTP office work be treated by the firm.  There are about 3 years left on the office lease, and he has six paralegals.  Overall, he estimates that the local overhead for his group is about $750,000, but those are off the top of his head numbers.  Does that overhead get rolled into the 30% the firm gets for each dollar received from clients?
2.	Some of the patent prosecution work he does for clients involve fixed fees.  How are fixed fees dealt with internally in the firm?  For example, suppose a client agrees to pay $5,000 in fees for a patent application and Allen asks another lawyer to draft the application, with Allen to review it.  Do Allen and the other lawyer agree in advance on how much the other lawyer will be paid for drafting the application? E.g., if the other lawyer’s internal rate is $250, and Allen and the other lawyer agree to $2,500 for drafting the application, does the other lawyer bill 10 hours?  Or is the fixed fee simply allocated between the lawyers?
3.	To what extent does Allen get to decide what docketing system his group will use?  Allen is aware of cloud-based docketing systems that would work well for his practice.
4.	Allen has to jump through some billing hoops for one of his clients, which involves applying certain client-generated codes to the bills.  Is there a way this can be automated.

IMPORTANT: 
Some of the most important items I need help exploring relate to the security systems, insurance, and other similar protocols/abilities that my key clients require from their law firm service providers. Given that my key clients are financial institutions, which tend to have stricter requirements than some other companies, I want to make sure I have the best understanding possible regarding the firm's ability to comply with these types of requirements.

I understand there is no way that you can definitively assure me that any given client will provide its approval before Rimon actually completes the formal process with that client.  Ethical and fiduciary obligations may prevent us from engaging with clients on these issues before I have formally decided to join your firm.

That being said, it would give me some peace of mind to know specific financial institutions that have approved Rimon after going through such a process, and whether the approval was for Rimon to be a ""panel law firm"" or a different, more limited approval.  To the extent it would help prior to your sharing that information for me to sign a confidentiality agreement (and/or other documentation regarding a more formal exploration of my joining the firm), I would be happy to do so.

It may also help for me to speak with the members of the Rimon team who address these sorts of requirements from various firm clients, and/or with other attorneys who have gone through the approval process of getting Rimon approved with their clients who are financial institutions. 

In case it is useful, the attached document highlights some of the types of requirements that I have seen from my clients.  It is difficult to provide a complete list since most of the back-and-forth happens in a portal and I do not have full visibility into that part of the process (which is handled b",RQL,"1.

I do not have the sense that he has a portable book or a sophisticated practice.  That being said, it would be great to have another sports lawyer to pitch with.

I have the same concerns - he has moved around a lot without very good reasons for doing so.  My experience tells me when that happens it is that people fall in love with the idea of a sports practice and then the business does not follow.  He could be different, but that has been my experience.

I have never worked with Anthony. We have a mutual friend (who has since tragically passed), but I do not know much more about him.

Their own overhead at Fisher is 16% on top of what Fisher pays (not clear what they include in this).

They worked out an agreement where Fisher treats Paralegal, Docketing, and Patent Agent fees as pass-through expenses - Fisher no longer takes a percentage from that.

A big issue for them is if Rimon can make transition easier for them.

Jonathan and Bryan are fantastic.  They were roommates in college and after attending separate law schools they have been in practice together ever since.  They have opened their own shop, worked at FisherBroyles and, about 1.5 years ago, joined Greenberg Trauig for better back office support and physical office space (only for a couple of their team).  They said there is much to like about GT but that they also see themselves getting priced out of the BigLaw market and they don't love the bureaucracy.  They do NOT want to reopen their own firm.

The group (I will get numbers from Jonathan soon) is about 20, including attorneys, patent agents, paras and staff and their book has been consistently around $7mm (they have over 10,000 files that would transfer).  They have a few main Bay Area clients, including Meta, Juniper, Netflix and others.  

Jonathan and Bryan have their own office which they purchased.  The only office space they would need would be for 4-5 of their team that at located in Salt Lake City.

At present, Bryan and Jonathan are in the exploratory phase.  They will provide additional details of their practice and the next step may be for MBM (and perhaps me, T.J., JZ?) to meet them in San Francisco.

""His mention of his government affairs practice and his separate real estate development, makes me think I might know where a lot of the reputational issue is coming from.   My guess , all conjecture, is that: (1) he is likely buying properties in low income areas; (2) utilizing his political connections to get local jurisdictions to make sure the “green zone” area where cannabis businesses are allowed is small and his property is within the green zone; (3) developing the property and getting it entitled; and then (4) leasing or selling the property to cannabis operators for a large mark-up. I am guessing he is not selling/leasing to his own clients (which would seem like a clear ethical violation), but, instead is doing this to non-clients.  The cannabis industry is a small industry, and this sort of behavior practice makes people in the industry upset that he using his understanding of the law and political connections to profit off of the operators.  
 
He also mentioned he helped cities write their cannabis ordinance.  That also could make certain operators feel like he was sabotaging their opportunity, whether or not accurate.  In terms of conflicts, yes, seeing his LPQ would be helpful.  His city work is part of my concern.  If my client is seeking a license from a city, that could disqualify us from helping.
 
In terms of his and his team’s abilities as attorneys, I am not sure we will be able to determine that from a call.  The subpar work product that my team saw was from several years ago.  And he did mention he has hired a team of experienced attorney.    I feel that other partners not involved in the cannabis space might be a good smell check to see what they think.""",,No,LCQ Sent,No,No,Cannabis Law,Chose more traditional firm,"Keller, Justin;Kobzeff, Lukian;Moradzadeh, Michael",zcrm_1837424000054901200,"We will definitely want to look closely at references here.

From Justin: Re: David's mixed reputation:
""...a lot of the early cannabis attorneys came from crim law sphere, and as their clients started cannabis businesses these types of attorneys became cannabis “business attorneys” overnight.  The crim law skillset is generally different from transactional/business law skillset, so in general, these old school cannabis attorneys weren’t that great.  I was telling you this, in the context of how my/Lukian’s practice differentiated ourselves and were able to get a decent market share pretty quickly.
 
Admittedly hearsay, David is one of those guys.  David is a known figure in LA cannabis law.  A few of my clients were formerly his clients and they said he was overpriced and slow.  Some documents his office prepared that were in our client’s files were pretty sloppy.  One client told me that David “stole my opportunity”.  
 
I do not know how much of this is true, if any, but, I do know that people in this space in LA know who David Welch is.
 
On the positive side, he does represent a good amount of capitalized cannabis groups (and some notable non-cannabis groups).  He has a reputation for being a trail blazer in the space.""

Ed's book is around $250k, but he is willing to work from home. Senior lawyer with great pedigree.

Per Peter: 
My actual billings for 2016 were $1,630,238 and my actual collections for 2016 were $1,547,725, for a realization rate of about 95% (copies attached). 
 
The firm modified the software in 2017 and such detailed reports were not available. I recalled my billings for 2017 amount to about $1.2m, and I collected about 1.12m, inclusive of some payments that came in during the first week of January 2018.

Feedback from Justin:
I generally agree with David’s comments.  There was a strange dynamic between Peter and Ed.  Peter seemed much more interested in Rimon, however he was very reserved about his interest.  I agree that he may have been holding back due to the possibility of joining Ed.

I think that Ed might be pricing himself out of the Silicon Valley patent prosecution market.  He only works on an hourly rate, and I have doubts that he is very efficient.  This likely accounts for his declining book of business.

Peter does patent prosecution on a fee capped model, however he is also a bit high.  I do not think this is as big an issue (as compared with Ed) because Peter is looking to do less patent prosecution work and he has a larger client base (especially in China).

My gut tells me that Rimon might benefit from Peter and not Ed.",,"1. Mark Nelson – Partners at Dentons for five years, worked together in litigation as well as prosecution work. Peter is very good technically and they worked very well together. Was well liked in the firm. He was always out getting business and worked hard at client development. Very good with clients. Time entries were efficient - never had to write any of his time off. As far as he could tell client, Peter's clients always paid on time.

2.Ian Crayford is a current client and former colleague - Peter initially interned for Ian 28 years ago. Since then, they have collaborated on projects together and Ian has been a client of Peter's for six years. Ian drafts his own patents and then has Peter review and advise on them. Peter's work product is excellent, efficient, and timely. He is very responsive and proactive. Ian feels he gets good value for his money and has never been surprised by his bill. Knows Peter very well and vouches for his high integrity.

3. Ed Radlo - Partners with Pete in two-partner firm before Pete went to Dentons. Has known him for 9 years. Pete is very honest, team player who will take on work asked for. Was planning on making Pete a name partner.

4. Richard Huang (formerly head of EE patent prosecution at Liu Shen & Associates) - Working together for over 13 years when Pete sent Chinese patent case to Richard. Pete is brilliant and handles US patents very well. He has also referred very good work to them. Clients have been very happy with him.","Clients are in the US, China and Europe, span across high-tech, energy and health care industries, with emphasis in artificial intelligence, robotics, mobile, Internet, social networking and semiconductor.

Very impressed by Richard's strategic thinking, ability to present and raise questions and introduce topics in an incredibly diplomatic and effective way. Great executive presence and polished. 

2. R. Holland Campbell, Senior Vice President, MGM Studios, Client/Friend (YS 4/17) - began working together around 2005. She was at ESPN heading up TM group. Worked with Nixon when Richard was there and gradually expanded Richard's role from TM, to licensing, to global expansion of Xgames. (Richard continued working with ESPN). MGM is not currently Richard's client because she inherited counsel, although she would hire him if she could. Always available when she needed him, great drafter in a business friendly manner. Very relatable. Able to expand way beyond his original mandate because he was so good at building relationships.

""His resume looks great.  Good undergrad, good law school, good technical background and good current firm.   Bad luck, too.  He joined two firms that went under.   
We also need more litigators on the east coast.  So definitely worth exploring more.
 
A few things for you to consider:
 
Is he litigating himself or he bringing clients/matters and relying on others?  A certain level of reliance is inevitable. For example, I won’t go in front of the jury in a conservative region of US.  But if he needs a lot of help, we don’t have enough litigators sitting there waiting for work. It means he should bring people with him, or we need to hire more litigators, especially on the east coast, to work with him.  
 
A number of Chinese IP litigators have really only done the technical side of IP litigation, basically they are patent/tech geeks.  They never argued motions, have taken very few depositions and never did anything in court.  They also often have never been involved in anything other than patent litigation.  That can be very good when there is a need for them.  But if you don’t want them, not so good.""","Zheng, Letao, Matt Poppe, Gabriel Gregg, Alen Chen, Steven Diaz Gavin, Steve Colby","1.	Jeannine Sano - Co-worker/mentor in White & Case - working together since Jason was a clerk in law school. Together at Dewey, then Howry, then White & Case. Jason is doing very well at White & Case, but billing rates are a problem for him. He is so good as what he does that clients ask for him by name, even when he was a junior associate. He would have been partner at a different office of White & Case, but in DC the expectation is to be counsel for a while first. It was just a matter of time that he would be made partner. He is great at developing business. Works well in a team - rowing in the same direction. Very direct and honest, no sugarcoating. Analysis is usually dead on.

2.	Sze Wong – Previous supervisor in the tech start-up, where Jason was senior engineer for three years. Great work ethic. Jason always solved the most difficult problems - someone they could rely on. Worked very well with people in a team of 4. Great communicator and highly reliable. Someone you can really trust.

3.	Shelley Zhuang – Client – in house - (Per Zheng:) Shelley finds Jason to be responsible, reporting timely, and providing good and practical suggestions.  She likes him and appreciates the way Jason provides legal services.  If Jason moves to a different firm, Shelley believes the company will follow Jason. Shelley’s trust in Jason is apparent.
In sum, Jason provides good services and this client trusts him.","Clients are in Chinese companies in high-tech, smartphone and consumer product space.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""We agree with you that the number of workers is too high in comparison to our turnover. There are simple reasons for that:
1.      We are a relatively new player in the market. Clients/contacts did not know our brand before June 2018. Therefore, we wanted to invest in profile raising, marketing material, legal newsletters and update, participation in conference, etc. we have generally two youngsters doing that for us. This strategy pays off because our firm is gaining visibility in Luxembourg and outside. 
 
2.      We wanted to create a practice unit focused on litigation. We have a litigation unit that is not entirely integrated in our firm (they are in a different building). They do business litigation, civil law, migration and a certain amount of pro bono work. The reason why we wanted this unit to be “separate” is to avoid the market perceiving us as a “litigation” firm. When our image will be strong enough as a business law firm and when the litigation unit reaches its performance objective, we will integrate it.
 
3.       The third reason is purely tactical: our clients are typically mid-size fortunes, private equity houses and multinationals (typical deal size ranges between €10 million to €800 million). Size does matter for this type of clients. If we are 4 of us, even if we are boast ourselves to be genuinely good at what we do, clients will not entrust us with sizable instructions for the wrong reasons. They would typically think that a firm of 6 or so lawyers cannot handle big closings where hundreds of millions are at stake.  We therefore need a critical mass merely for a perceptual/psychological reasons. 
 
We believe our model is healthy because it fits our ambitions: organic growth. We have a big potential yet to explore and translate into real profits. That is the reason why we are interested in a bigger network - to accelerate growth and open new doors for us to develop.""",,,(See client list in Presentation - attached),Other: see notes section,See Notes,,,,,,,,Growing current firm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a.	Resulting annual cost is $4,320. Not bad
3.	Office – this is more challenging. He doesn’t necessarily need an office right now, but he does need someplace where he and some paralegals can use a high speed copier as needed, mail fedex, etc. He suggested WeWork, but I honestly don’t know how that work or what the costs might be. We’ll have to find out.

Reading between the lines, I did get the sense that Tim and the Philadelphia office are getting jettisoned as a cost-saving measure for the firm.
Andrew Maher: I spoke to another of Tim’s references today. It was with an attorney who worked alongside Tim as an associate for 8 years at two different firms. They’re friends. It was a totally positive reference check, EXCEPT when the reference slipped up. He had four kids screaming in the background and it may have caused him to lose focus. Here’s what happened: I asked if he could speak at all to Tim’s honesty and integrity. He began by saying that he thinks Tim is totally trustworthy, never questioned his honesty, and then said something like “ the whole thing with the lawsuit and Fisher Broyles, I really think it was just a slip up, because it had been dismissed, but I don’t think he intended anything, etc.”. I didn’t know what he was talking about, but I realized he slipped up, and wanted to probe a little further. So I asked him if he was referring to the lawsuit by his former clients and he said yes. And I asked what Fisher’s connection to all this was. He paused, because he realized he goofed. He danced around a little, and I didn’t want to press him because I knew he’d feel terrible, but I think I gleaned that he got pretty far along in conversations with Fisher, and failed to disclose the lawsuit against him, and Fisher found out.

Ongoing Discussions,"Business Plan:

Startups: Startups that touch on the sports betting space require corporate counsel who is familiar with the space (and its associated pitfalls) as well as regulatory counsel to guide them through each state in which they seek to do business.  I reasonably expect that I can generate approximately $75k in first-year fees through this channel.

·        Vigit: I am an advisor to this sports betting social platform, which is raising a Series A.  They are using outside counsel that is not as familiar with gaming and quite expensive.  They will need ongoing work involving both their corporate structure and potential gaming regulatory issues.

·        Bet Prophet:  I am informally advising this startup gaming company.  They are live in the UK and will need experienced gaming counsel in the US for regulatory issues.

·        Betcha: I am informally advising this company and previously referred them to outside counsel who was experienced in gaming work, but he recently left his firm.

Gaming: Gaming companies generally have experienced counsel but are often looking for other attorneys who understand the space to do certain types of work at a lower cost.  They are also actively seeking to partner with or acquire smaller companies within this space.  I reasonably expect that I can generate approximately $100k in first-year fees through this channel.

·        Rush Street Gaming: Rivers/SugarHouse is one of their affiliated entities.  They have a need for outside legal work to be done less expensively, most notably for their Rush Street Interactive division, which has a number of licensing and other more routine agreements that need to be redlined.  I am close with the lead of legal/compliance and CEO for Rush Street Gaming, as well as the President and General Counsel for Rush Street Interactive.  They are continuing to expand their online operations across numerous jurisdictions.

·        Penn National:  I know their General Counsel well and their former GC is a good friend.  They are aggressively growing their online platform.

·        Wind Creek:  They recently expanded into PA by acquiring Sands Bethlehem.  I know their PA property GC very well.  They are a tribal entity and their PA acquisition is their first foray into state-regulated gaming.

·        Kambi:  This European sports betting B2B provider recently established a US presence and has told me that they are waiting to bring on US-based inhouse counsel.  I worked closely with this company and know several of their executives. 

Sports:  Teams, leagues, and schools are eager to generate sponsorship dollars associated with sports betting while also worried about various compliance issues.  I reasonably expect that I can generate approximately $50k in first-year fees through this channel. 

·        Eagles:  Their deputy GC (and her husband) are friends, as is their former SVP in charge of corporate partnerships who remains close with several executives there.  They are actively exploring this space and have dipped their toe in the water but are looking to do far more.

·        Flyers:  I sit on a non-profit board with their GC and have negotiated a deal with them before when I was at Rivers.  They are active in this space as well as the esports space and have a casino being built next door to their arena.

·        NCAA:  I have contacts with a number of collegiate conferences that are increasingly worried about compliance issues.

Venture: Venture capital firms that are looking at deals within this space need counsel who is familiar with the regulatory issues surrounding it.  They also serve as a pipeline for introductions to startups.  I reasonably expect that I can generate approximately $75k in first-year fees through this channel. 

·        SeventySix Capital: I am close with the Managing Partner and am likely joining his company’s advisory arm.  They are active in the world of sports tech investing.

·        Red & Blue: I am close with the Managing Partner.  He has told me that he is looking to get involved in tech companies related to sports and sports betting.

·        Osage: One of their principals is a close friend from college.  They are very cost sensitive and I believe there is a great opportunity to become involved with their acquisitions and/or portfolio companies.

·        Stadia:  I know their managing partner and have been asked to judge a prior startup competition. 

Athletes: Similar to sports teams, current athletes are looking at the sponsorship opportunities available within this space, and former athletes are looking at investment opportunities.  I reasonably expect that I can generate approximately $50k in first-year fees through this channel. 

·        SeventySix Capital Athlete Venture Group:  See above re SeventySix.  One of their arms attracts post-athletic career athletes who are looking to become involved in businesses.  They are often in need of trusted advisors.

·        Neustadt Group:  The head of this sports agency has been a friend since childhood.  Several of his clients pursue opportunities after their playing careers are over.

Law firm collaboration: Several law firms with relationships in the sports world are being asked to work on deals that involve betting/gaming issues and lack the expertise to do so.  I reasonably expect that I can generate approximately $50k in first-year fees through this channel. 

·        Morgan Lewis:  They have a robust sports practice but nobody who understands the gaming landscape.  They have told me that they would like to hire me as gaming counsel to help them on deals.

·        Saul Ewing:  They have a burgeoning sports practice as well but do not have experienced gaming attorneys.  They have spoken with me about working together on certain deals.

Other (non sports/gaming): I reasonably expect that I can generate approximately $100k in first-year fees through this channel. 

·        Glenmede Trust:  Their GC is a good friend.  He was previously the GC at Penn National.

·        Post Brothers:  Their GC is a friend who is always looking to reduce his costs.

·        Day & Zimmermann:  My cousin is their in-house counsel who oversees all employment issues.",,No,LCQ Sent,No,No,"Sports, Entertainment, and Recreation",Book was not high enough,"Moradzadeh, Michael;Pace, Matthew",zcrm_1837424000000648057,,,,,,,,,,,Fox Rothschild,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ongoing Discussions,"He needs two senior associates (or service partners) with good credentials to do the work he generates

From Brian Hafter: (Confidential)
 1.   I don’t see a book of $1.5 million or anything close to it – and I expect that much or a part of his “book” is on contingency fee.  Whether he would have success replicating his alleged book from North Carolina seems suspect.
 
2.  He has been a party to lawsuits/arbitrations with his former firm and with clients.  That’s a red flag for sure.    I am personally friends with Miles Feldman (a name partner at Raines Feldman).  Miles is a stand up guy.   At the right time, I can reach out and find out about this guy, if asked to do so.  
 
3.  He seems to bounce around a lot – and even left the recent firm he started (where he was the lead name partner).  Another red flag.
 
4.   Quite significantly, our litigators appear before JAMS in arbitration and mediations all the time.   I have two mediations before JAMS this week alone, and many pending arbitrations.   For me, his CURRENT lawsuit against JAMS alone would be a deal breaker – because we cannot risk a JAMS arbitrator being biased against Rimon in an unrelated case that the firm is handling.  Fair or not,  I frankly don’t care whether his case against JAMS has merit or not . . . you can’t sue JAMS and expect your partners to regularly practice law before that body.   We run the risk of getting tagged with it.   
 
5.  This concerns me as well:   “I am looking to bill 750 hours per year managing cases.  I need a firm with associates and service partners who can help me monetize my book which enables me to focus on bringing in business.”   The reality is that we don’t have the types of litigation associates he is talking about – i.e., ones that are sitting around waiting to handle cases that he would “manage” – let alone litigation associates outside of California.   We also cannot hand over one of his “very specialized” cases to a (part-time) associate like Laura or Kendra – who lack experience to handle such matters – for him to supervise (from North Carolina).   While we are successful at handling cases remotely, this presents a set of challenges we are not equipped to handle through our current (small) litigation associate pool.   While I am always happy to discuss personally handling litigation that our partners bring in, I also don’t have an interest in handling cases for this particular lawyer (at least based on what I have seen so far) – and I am confident lawyers like Scott Raber and others would view this opportunity similarly.   To be clear, if he is suing JAMS, that alone is enough for me to say “no” – because of how it could impact my other clients in unrelated cases.

After we joined our current firm in 2012, the firm leased our building to house satellite operations for the practice. The firm occupies most of the space but has continued to lease space to the tenants.

Early Discussions,"attached please find my numbers for the months of January, February, March, and the first 15 days of April 2020. They are pretty consistent so far; I waited until mid-April to confirm consistency. These numbers are directly from the firm's case management software; they take into account my clients only, 95% of which will come with me. They do not reflect any of my partner's clients, who may also decide to leave (whether entirely or just in part). I'd rather use conservative numbers on my end; if they end up being improved, great for us. 

Some of my cases are on contingency (for example, I have an appeal on contingency where the other side posted a bond) or on a hybrid fee, where there is a premium to a lower hourly rate if I end up winning the case; however, these are the exception. 

As far as the employees that I would like to bring with me, as stated, there are three. 
1. Tereza Horakova, Esq. who lives in NYC and makes $104k per year. She bills at $300 per hour (litigation)
2. Valeria Angelucci, Esq. who lives in South Florida and makes $75k per year. She bills at an equivalent of $250 per hour, but I am working improving that (corporate work). 
3. Yolanda Arencibia, who is the paralegal in charge of the real estate closings, at $50k per year. She bills work for $120k per year. 

My rate is $350/400 per hour.

I told Tereza and Valeria about a potential change of firm, to make sure that they do not have an objection in principle. They do not. I have not yet spoken to Yolanda, because the situation is a bit more delicate. She is best friend with the other paralegal at the firm, who won't be able to join, and thus I want to wait a bit before mentioning the idea of moving firm. 

As I mentioned, and as reflected on the partial numbers, my portfolio this year should be $800k (average of $60k per month), without including any extra work that my partner's clients may decide they want to give me or any work my team and I may be able to do for Rimon's other partners. 

I understand that Rimon has generally a policy whereby the numbers work if there are at least $500k per lawyer in portfolio, due to some fixed costs like legal research, malpractice, insurance, third party software, etc. These fixed costs are billed on a ""per lawyer"" basis even if they end up not being used by the lawyer. 

Accordingly, I understand that you need to look into whether my numbers work with three lawyers. After our call I went back and looked at the billables - the expectation is that Tereza bills around $350k, Valeria $250k and Yolanda $120k. With those numbers, all I am left to bill is around $100k. How is that? The problem that I have been having at the firm where I am now is that I bill a lot (A LOT) of non-billable for administrative, management, and marketing. This includes touching up the website, the LinkedIn page, fixing the software for the team etc. We have an IT Company, but sometimes it's just better and easier for me to do it directly. Add to that the rainmaking, and I have very little time available to actually bill. Of course, I bill in excess of $100k a year ($250/300k), but the excess goes towards my partner's portfolio. So, if I were to move to Rimon and free up my time, arguably, I would be able to bill more and increase the portfolio. The question is whether I would have the actual work to bill on, as billable hours are not perfectly elastic with available time.

However, I am not comfortable letting go of Valeria and Tereza (or Yolanda, for that matter). They are the backbone of what I built to date. They are super smart, committed, and resolution-oriented. I would prefer to cut my compensation to make up for the lack of a portfolio that is sufficient to cover the fixed ""per user"" cost. Then, once I am part of Rimon I am confident that I can grow my portfolio - and maybe other partners will realize the great value that the three of them bring to the table and that would be able to offset some (or all) of the ""per user"" costs.",,No,Not Yet Sent,No,No,Commercial Litigation;Real Estate,Chose to stay at current firm,"Moradzadeh, Michael",zcrm_1837424000000534105,"HE IS WILLING TO MAKE A LITTLE LESS TO MAKE THE NUMBERS WORK FOR US

Due Diligence Stage,"Matt Poppe's Notes: 6/23
""..He told me about the trademark case and, I believe, said the client is hesitant to spend money on it.  He didn’t mention Kent Displays by name, but he mentioned the type of work he does for them and didn’t indicate it was very high volume.
 
He did mention that he has a couple of potential ITC actions in play, but he described one as essentially dead and said he’s been working on the other for several months but the funder is inclined to stick with District Court litigation for now.  So neither sounded like a hot prospect.  Clearly if he were to bring in an ITC case, that would generate a lot of revenue.  But given his niche specialty, he didn’t sound to me like the type of person who is likely to generate a new case on his own.  And for that same reason, he doesn’t seem like a big value-add to me.  People with technical backgrounds are strong selling points for ITC and other patent cases, not people who focus on non-technical issues and shy away from the technical stuff.""

Jason Xu Notes 6/23:
""I agree with Matt’s assessment.  I think he adds value to the IP practice, especially when we have ongoing 337 investigations, and he would be great as part of the pitching team.  His international trade experience can also complement others’ practice.  That being said, it might not be easy for him to generate a new 337 investigation given his usual business development methods.  The LPQ numbers may be more on the potential side.

Ongoing Discussions,"Alan Chen Notes:
I have worked with Jayashree on a few small matters and one large litigation in the past 2 to 3 years. We shared associates and worked with many of the same partners within the IP practice group (prior firm).
 
That said, the descriptions below are not consistent with my understanding of her book. Though she has the core background and competence, she worked with a group of other partners on business development and I am uncertain about how much of her book is truly portable. She was brought in as a service partner and I don’t think that role evolved very much. 
 
Also, she is generally very aggressive in litigation, and her billing reflects that attitude. Because of that, relationship partners need to keep a close eye on her cases to adhere to budget and client expectations. 

That said, I think there is value in talking with her if you expect the IP team needs additional support in the form of service partners. 

Please note my knowledge of her book is slightly outdated, and there is usually room in a large IP team for members with different litigation styles, even if it is very different from my own preferences. The discussion re her aggressiveness was not meant to raise doubt about her credibility relating to competence. The issue is how aggressive litigators can drove up cost of litigation and create a lot of tension within the associate (difficult assignments and workloads) and partnership ranks (budgeting and client management). That’s just based on my observation by working with her from a distance, and on feedback from other partners who worked closely with her. I think these concerns would be alleviated if she is primarily servicing her own clients.

Note from MBM call: they really dumped on quality of work by other Fox Rothschild partners. They said they were unresponsive and overbilled, requiring them to constantly write-down hours. They also believe Fox expanded haphazardly, bringing in a lot of subpar solo practitioners,

Notes from recruiter:
""I try to make it a practice not to disparage any law firms as I don’t have first hand knowledge about how things work at any particular firm, but by multiple accounts Fox Rothschild sounds like a place where folks have some pretty sharp elbows, more senior partners poach credit for matters that more junior partners bring in.
 
Dan was my initial point of contact and was ready to dismiss me when I mentioned Rimon as he has been receiving a lot of calls from headhunters for Rimon who apparently didn’t represent your firm’s model effectively. I was able to dispel some of his misconceptions and he became interested in learning more but he has questions/concerns that I think are born out of his experiences in working in big law. 

In particular, Dan wondered about how the ability to set one’s internal rate, and change it over time, didn’t lead to internal bidding wars and partners trying to jockey and undercut other partners by dropping rates by $25/hour and making themselves more attractive to handle matters.""

""I spoke to the first two references and they were all positive. I asked them both if they had any insights on why he might have left Ropers before having a definite place to land, and got two different answers. 

One said that he’d heard that Ivan had received an offer from a firm that was suspended when COVID hit. The other said he’d heard that Ropers was having some financial difficulties, may have even missed payroll. So if we don’t already know, and we haven’t probed the issue, we would need to ask Ivan himself to learn more. 

So there’s that. Also, they help support that he has SOME business. Klopert seems like a high profle lawyer who legitimately refers work whenever he can. And Kousa is a happy client who relies on Ivan. Although together, it’s certainly less than 100k per year. 

In sum, from two references, I can tell that he’s got SOME business, that two clients/referral sources like him, and that we still don’t know why he’s in limbo.""","LA Team for welcome.

Clients and Friends:

As of November 1, 2020, I have joined my old friend, Kareem Hajjar, and his partners, at Hajjar Peters (HP).  My new contact information is below.  

At HP, we will continue to serve transactional and other clients who are a good fit for my practice, expertise, and way of doing business.  For the clients who join me here, we will provide the same level of service and sophistication that they have come to expect.  But at a far lower cost; and with fewer meaningless distractions.  

As for my prior firm, Norton Rose Fulbright (NRF), I have this to say: we are coming for your clients.  All of them.  Because we are better; smarter; more nimble; and so much less bloated than you are.    

Our clients aren’t suckers.  They can spot the difference between good value and overlawyering.  Certainly better than the leadership of NRF can, anyway.

""sounds good. And in terms of the size of his book, I believe that he has a good understanding of how the economics will work at the firm and what he will net. If that works for him, then I think he would be a good addition for the reasons stated. You may want to confirm with him one more time that he is good with how the economics will work.

On the paralegal issue, Yaacov and I discussed this, and I have discussed it with Joe. I understand that we will be hiring a litigation paralegal in San Francisco, and that this person won't be fully consumed work. I believe that Joe could share that resource, backstopped by Denise here in Menlo Park. I don't think he needs anyone close to full time.

**2419SF!114

From Joe: ""With respect to the billing history from my solo practice, you will notice that my total collections were relatively flat between 2017 and
2018.  This is mainly because we were waiting for payment on a number of probate matters, which did not start paying out until 2019.  For part-year 2019, January through August (8 months), my collections
nearly matched full-year 2017 and 2018.  Had I remained in solo practice for the balance of 2019, I expect my total collections for the year would have been $350,000 to $400,000.

At AYHMH, I do not have access to billings and collection data.  Based on my monthly invoice reviews, I did my best to recall billable and
collection figures.  From September 2019 through May 2020 (the 9 months since I have been at AYHMH), I estimate that my billables are
in the range of $350,000 to $400,000.  Of those billables, approximately $250,000 is collected.  Again, we are waiting to collecton a number of probate matters, as well as a large conservatorship
matter.  As those additional payments come in, my collections at AYHMH are on track to exceed my solo practice substantially.  (Please note,
these are only the matters on which I am the responsible attorney.  I billed additional time on various other matters being handled by other
attorneys in the firm.)""",,No,LCQ Received,Yes,No,Trusts and Estates,Joined Rimon,"Hafter, Brian;Moradzadeh, Michael;Rose, Filmore;Ross, Scott;Whittemore, Ajay;Zosky, Michael",zcrm_1837424000008640131,"YPS Notes 7/10/20:
""they're fine references. Consistent with what we know already, I don't think he's ever going to bring in a lot of business. But if we're comfortable with that, I think he'll be a quality attorney""

His LPQ portable book info is unimpressive. Seems like only $100k is portable. This all comes down to how helpful he would be to Scott Ross. Not worth taking on his own.

Scott Ross notes 6/22/20:
""I like him a lot. I know that Fil did as well.  I think that he would be a good addition.  It would be helpful to have another estate planning attorney here in California, and especially in San Francisco.  It will give comfort to estate planning clients overall that we have a larger group.  I will be able to send him some work, but I told him that this was likely but that he shouldn’t base his decision on that or count on that.  His numbers aren’t that large, and so the question would be whether it works for him economically under our model.  Bottom line, I’m a yes . .""

On Hold,"Buz's feedback upon presenting: 
I vote yes, but I have materially lower expectations for Jim's economic success at Rimon than he may have for himself, for a few reasons.  

(1) his revenue expectations depend substantially upon his trustee work, which I am not at all convinced will follow him, except possibly for his Japanese financial client (can we test this?) and (1)(a), making the most of his trustee work will in his particular case depend upon hiring and billing out his paralegal, whom Michael may reasonably want him to pay for, and Jim may reasonably not want to take that risk. 

2) His asset finance and leasing work is not one that will throw off anything to the rest of us, even to Q, who can do the same things, but for a different client base.  Jim states that he does throw off litigation, bankruptcy, and tax and I do not contest that, but my guess is that it is not significant, and will be less if all of his trustee work does not come along with him.  Do we know differently? 

(3) Not for nothing, but in my long experience the concept of an ""energy efficiency finance practice"" is a chimera-ish, if not entirely wishful extrapolation derived from maybe two interesting, clever, and inventive (but by now probably failed and in litigation) deals, and not an industry trend (unless it is a downward trend) or even a niche.  

Nevertheless, if he sticks to it, Jim can probably make a nice living from his business plan at Rimon and in terms of structured asset finance, he and Q would make a solid team presentation that would cover everything finance-able.  But either of them could and would do the largest and most complicated deals in their collective space without help from the other.  Gun to my head, I would predict that Jim will choose another traditional law firm model, or suck it up and stay at McCarter English, for safety, and I would not say that would be a wrong decision.  We would probably not hurt ourselves by saying yes, because he is a serious and well-credentialed transactional attorney with very serious clients in his current firm,  and a clear bias for business development and collaboration, but we would not be hurting him by saying no.",Received,No,Received,Yes,Yes,Corporate;Financial Services,Unresponsive after numerous follow up,"Barclay, Bernays;Larson, Emma;Moradzadeh, Michael;Trachtenberg, Stephen",zcrm_1837424000000110338,His paralegal gets about $90k a year - billed out at $275 per hour,,"1) David Adler (Exec Committee and Partner at McCarter): Worked together on many matters including Deutsche Bank's Tribune indentured trustee case for eight years - $3Bil matter with $8Mil in billings that went through a trial that James brought in. Says James is ""best trustee lawyer I have seen."" James works well with others in the firm and is highly trusted and liked. David asked James not to leave the firm, but James wants to go somewhere that is more collaborative and flexible.

2) David Doucette (Client, VP @ US Bank)- Jim has represented David for 11 years in all matters. Jim knows corporate trust and municipal work inside out. Work is done efficiently and expertly. Very accessible and quick. Close about 4-5 deals a year together, and plan to continue doing so.

3) James Giaimo (client, VP of Hitachi) - Hitachi has been his client for 20 years and James Giaimo has been working with him for 12 years. Everyone thinks very highly of him and sees him as their go-to lawyer. Excellent lawyer, great in a team, honest, direct, and easy to work with. Highly recommended. They plan to continue giving him same level of work (above $300k a year).","Jim also acts as Trustee for his big financials like Wells Fargo, for their deals.

Early Discussions,"From Zheng 12/18/20:
""Andy Liu, Jim, Judy, Jessie and I have all been part of Caloba, a Chinese lawyers’ organization in Northern CA.  In Caloba’s group chat, Andy frequently tried to grab work that he had no experience in (he was trained as a patent prosecutor but he often tried to get work outside his field, and it was done when he was still relatively junior). We have had some other minor interactions with him.  While all our interactions were somewhat short in duration, we were not impressed with his character.  
 
We do not have any direct knowledge as to his legal skills.  He had applied for an associate position at Orrick when I was there and an associate position at DWT when Judy was there.  Neither time the partner in charged hired him.  I also heard that some partners at Haynes & Boone who were not happy with his performance there. Haynes & Boone tried to recruit me when I was leaving Orrick.  As part of the conversation, Chinese language associate help came up, and I was told that he was about to be let go so I could not count on using him.  We both prefer not to work with him. ""

From Judy 12/18/20:
"" I don’t believe Andy will be a partner fit for us. 
 
I had limited interactions with him in the past. I recalled he had reached out to me when DWT patent practice posted an ad for recruiting an associate, so we chatted briefly. Prior to that I had had the impression that he was very active on Caloba. 
 
He had stricken me, when he was a junior attorney, as one who was focused don business development among startups with some sort of China nexus. He was a bit too aggressive in my taste in providing advice not in his area, such as corporate, and was too comfortable with giving advice in order to get the clients.

Quatrini and Coca-Cola hit: ""potential conflict with Coca Cola has concluded.  We no longer have any conflict issue. ""

Cleared in 2020, but will need to run again.",,"Unedited notes from YPS 9/17/20:
I am writing my notes here, as I’m never really sure what to place in the public vs private notes but want to convey my thoughts in a somewhat linear way. 

I spoke with Julia today for about 40 minutes. She’s a little strange, personality wise. Somewhat scattered, I’d say. But in fairness, I goofed and called her a day early, so she wasn’t exactly prepared. That might also excuse that she didn’t seem to know anything about me. She also said a few things that, even if true, were a little odd to bring up. For example, she mentioned that part of the reason she left McDermott is that another partner at the firm was spreading false rumors that she was having an affair with a senior partner, and she couldn’t take that level of drama. Also, she is apparently anti-Peloton for some reason. Doesn’t really matter. Just something that came up ?

But somehow, she grew on me through the conversation, and my impression changed of her from simply a little odd, to maybe someone who is a genuine person who doesn’t have the best filter. Substantively, she indeed seems to be what we’re looking for, a real privacy lawyer through and through, who can meet the vast majority of our needs in this area. She has solid clients marquis clients (like S&P Global), and feels that $1M is reliable. She is ultimately looking for a place the she enjoys working, feels part of a team. She said it meant a lot to her that Michael and I both spoke to her directly, and that she gets a warm impression from having spoken to us – she seemed to genuinely appreciate the outreach. (Interestingly, she also said that she spoke to some folks at Fisher, but that they just didn’t seem like nice, genuine people. Strange that we seem to be hearing this a lot lately.)

The other really odd thing was that she communicated anxiety over losing her guaranteed comp, and that this was the biggest factor in stopping her from making a move. Fortunately, I asked her to do some math with me together. She is currently earning $425k, and she mulled that “I’d have to earn 1.2M at Rimon to earn that, and I feel like I’m solidly at 1.” I jumped in to say, that math doesn’t sound right – you’d have to do 607k to reach that number. She seemed genuinely surprised, and realized that she’d been making a big mistake in her calculations. Perhaps that’s concerning. Perhaps she just wasn’t thinking about it much. But her tone immediately changed, and she suddenly seemed eager to make something happen. She will work on the LPQ and get it back to us very soon (so she says). She also needs to get back to Jeff Fromm.",,Yes,LCQ Received,Yes,Yes,Cybersecurity;Privacy,Chose to stay at current firm,"Moradzadeh, Michael;Rosenbaum, Joseph;Silberman, Yaacov;Wisneski, Ed",zcrm_1837424000008748119,"Julia remains very interested in Rimon but she has had a couple of issues that has required her to delay coming on board.  First, she has been caring for her 93 year old mom.   However, that is not the main reason she needed to delay.  Her largest client S&P Global merged with another entity.  As a result, her billings for that client dropped from $30k to $5k/month.  The same happened to her second largest client, ZipWhip and her billings went from $15-20K/month to $5k/month.

Since these setbacks, she has started to build up her client base again.  She added Coca Cola (her friend at S&P moved to Coke) and is now billing them $30k/month.

She wants us to continue to put things on hold for now, but asked that we touch base in one month (I added a task).  Once she feels comfortable with the stability of her clients, she wants to join us.","Joe Rosenbaum, Katie, Mikhail, Chris Terry, Zheng and Sarah?",(See archived),"Large tech companies, S&P Global, Jagger LLC, Zipwip, Global Partners (oil & gas distributor), rail Europe",,1 to 10 hours a week,,,Flexibility in billing;International/Regional capabilities,,,,,"Agreement was signed - target start was at Feb 1, 2021 but Julia did not join.

Julia has also been frustrated over the years with the funds expended on unnecessary overhead at traditional firms.

I know Xiaowei is still looking at the Hainan angle (sidetracked due to COVID), and not sure what the Firm interest level in opening up in Shanghai is, given the application process (and having to juggle multiple irons in the fire in terms of permission to have two law firm offices in China). My feeling is that once Xiaowei with my and others’ assistance gets Hainan moving, Rocky in and of himself is no reason to distract from our goal. Xiaowei would know whether we could simultaneously open an office in Hainan and one in Shanghai, but the latter is notoriously oversaturated.

My observations of practice in China leads me to believe that no one lawyer can start a standalone deal or litigation practice in China that can compete in a crowded market without both (a) a team and (b) an office, so you are right, there would be significant costs associated with starting an office in a place like Shanghai. There is the possibility that he could, singlehandedly without a team but probably still requiring an office, be a significant source of referrals to our US offices. My take would be to suss out whether (a) he needs, and can bring, a team in order to realize his own book and (b) he is able to refer work. I think he has the burden of proof on this.

I did some checking with old friends at Lovells (now Hogan Lovells). They gave me lukewarm feedback on Rocky. While he may have developed a strong practice in the five years since he was there, I think it would increase his already significant burden of proof.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.8374240000163635e+18,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ongoing Discussions,"Steve Eichel's initial thoughts:
While Marc has what I would consider to be a reasonably impressive resume if I were looking for a mid-to-senior-level tax associate, I see some of the subtle clues that generally indicate that he is probably not yet the type of “first chair” attorney who would really have achieved a half-million-dollar book of business that he had truly originated himself.

The “representative matters” described strike me as too granular and disparate in subject matter to suggest a deep enough core practice focus to have the kind of credibility in the marketplace that would support that level of revenue consistently.  For example, it does not strike me as likely that a single tax attorney would be handling both international tax issues involved in inbound entry of foreign companies into the U.S. market while at the same time handling fairly esoteric Rhode Island state and local tax issues, along with IRS audits on worker classification issues, UBTI and 409A and ERISA issues.  No one could possibly cover all those highly diverse and unrelated areas competently, particularly only 13 years out of law school.  I don’t know Marc and haven’t heard of Marc, and my comments above are not to say that he might not be a perfectly fine budding tax attorney.  Rather, in my experience, taking all of the facts I can glean from his resume in the aggregate, I have trouble believing that he is really as he is being presented by the recruiter—an established rainmaker with a substantial portable book of business—as opposed to a developing tax and/or business attorney who has had a wide range of experiences and projects in many diverse areas while he figures out a long-term focus for his career.  I just get the sense that there is some substantial puffing going on here in terms of what he has “worked on” (for what is likely other originators) versus work that he has actually generated on his own.  I could certainly be wrong, but that’s my first impression for what it’s worth.",,No,LCQ Sent,No,No,Corporate;Tax,Started own firm,"Eichel, Steven;Moradzadeh, Michael",zcrm_1837424000001090047,Per recruiter 12/04/20: He is very comfortable knowing that he would take 70% of his book and is very interested in the Rimon law firm model.,,,family offices and family businesses,None,,,Employment Law;Intellectual Property;Trusts and Estates,Collaboration model;Compensation Structure,,,,,"His dream was always to start his own firm, so he decided to make the jump.",Marc is seeking a more sophisticated and nimble platform to help him grow and service his growing client base.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.8374240000141443e+18,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Update from recruiter 5/11/21:
•	We talked about his net, which he calls his “compensation to fees ratio” and he estimated that it has been about 49% of his 1.3 to 1.4 M collections. 
•	I think that if he can find cost effective support for his practice at Rimôn, he can increase that ratio and create a positive differential for himself each year he stays with Rimôn relative to the comp/fees ratio he has at his current firm. 
•	If we take him at his latest indication today, it means he nets around $ 661,500 on average collections of 1.35 M. (49% times 1.35 M) 
•	He said his current firm runs a fairly “lean operation” and that they give him a free cell phone and a few other perks. 
•	He may have been intimating that he hopes to see what he can receive from Rimôn by way of perks in return for the 30% portion of his revenues he shares with the firm.

Duccio was a candidate back in 2020.  He believes that Rimon has grown and matured and that there would be plenty of synergies with Rimon partners and that he would be able to have help with his matters.

Duccio is based in LA.  When he first interviewed with Rimon the idea was for him to possibly lead the effort in opening an office in Milan.  He now wants to simply focus on growing his practice here in the US.  He expressed interest in possibly moving to Miami at some point and believes there are significant client opportunities there.  

He understands the Rimon model and is very interested in continuing the process. Prior interviewers (in 2020) seemed to have a bit of an issue with Duccio's personality/ego but I found him to be pleasant, engaging and bright.  I think he would make a fine partner addition to Rimon.",,,Corporate: 60%; Litigation 30% Others (mainly licensing/soft IP),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Tanya is the spouse of Daniel Cohen who was previously the CEO of DOCOMO Digital here in the US – a client.  There is a long version, but the short one is that DOCOMO bought the company from an Italian mobile entertainment, content and media company called Buongiorno.   DOCOMO is NTT DOCOMO, the largest (and originally the national carrier) telecommunications company in Japan and among the largest in Asia and while I could bore you with the strategic reasons, in brief DOCOMO decided to scrap the original entertainment oriented business and re-focus the entire global business on becoming an e-commerce and global e-commerce/payments platform.  Obviously Daniel didn’t agree and they parted ways amicably. He and I are still in touch and hopefully he lands somewhere that again becomes a client as well.
 
Daniel called the other day and mentioned his wife is an immigration lawyer – essentially US-UK focused (they are originally British and now live here) – and was looking to alter her practice relationships and he mentioned me and Rimon to her and asked if I would speak with her.

•	When I spoke at length with Victor, I went over the practice description that Tom prepared in great detail. Victor indicated that when he was at Ivins, Phillips & Barker for the 13 years prior to moving to Jones Day in 2017, he worked in some capacity on virtually every aspect of what Tom outlined.  Ivins is a boutique that focuses on Benefits & Compensation and also Tax matters and while Victor feels that he is more current on certain aspects of what Tom outlined, he is comfortable taking on any matter related to Tom's description.  
•	He also has a strong interest in further developing business including his charitable foundation work, which has been a challenge at Jones Day since they are not supportive of that endeavor and because of rate resistance by potential new clients at the high rate Jones has set for him.  He feels that both the RIMÔN model and the opportunity to offer rate flexibility on new matters would be a huge plus for him in developing business.  
•	He is very comfortable representing a current book of $500K and that in 2020, it was around $650K.

Debra was preferred provider for portfolio companies: Formation, GC, IP, Financing, Acquisition, etc. Very positive reviews, they used to work with many lawyers and then consolidated into Debra. Billing was always fair. Never questioned integrity over 5 years. Things highly of her on a technical level. No reservations. 

2) Stephanie Wang, JD, PhD, a former colleague at DLA, recently moved in-house at Grail, 415-290-8415
Worked closely with Debra serving the patent needs of her clients. She was an associate under Debra. Thinks she was very thoughtful. Clients trusted her fully. When Stephanie left behind clients at DLA, they requested to stay with Debra. She is friendly, easy to get along with. Stephanie is in a different practice area, so hard for her to evaluate Debra from a technical standpoint. But it would be good if we have a strong IP practice to support her clients.

""My last significant pitch at Orrick was a significant patent case representing a well-known Chinese company.  The head of IP at that time pushed me to add more than one person of the Houston team (including Claudia) on the pitch proposal.  It made it impossible to keep the team small as I still need the people with Electrical Engineering background or Chinese language capability.  We did not get the case even though we had an excellent proposal otherwise.  That was actually a big reason for me to decide to leave.  It was my long term client and I knew what type of the lawyers I should put on the team.  But the management was not letting me decide how to pitch.  I don’t think Claudia or her team had anything to do with it, it was the management.  But this experience confirmed what Matt was saying that the Houston team under-performed financially.  Again, Claudia and team are likely great fit for Rimon.

PRIVATE: Sent 9/18/20 by Manaf:
Figures regarding the expenses we anticipate to be included in the 30%:
- Offices : 250 square meters (1 open space for all the lawyer regardless of their status/seniority and 1 meeting room): 150,000€
- Marketing expenses: 25,000€/annum
- Client events: 20,000€/annum
- Trade association: 20,000€/annum
- 1 PA/receptionist: 45,000€/annum
- Marketing staff, shared with other EU offices
- liability insurance (if there a way to use the Rimon global insurance, that works for us)
- legal websites costs (Lexis Nexis, electronic closing sites.
The last two are not significant enough to be assessed at this stage.

Obviously, from the list of things covered by the 30% in the US, if some of them are applicable (one time travel for partners, tools, etc.) many of them are not applicable to us (example: medical insurance, US located services...). So this might constitute an economy for the firm. 

All the above expenses are going to be increased with those related to the required installations for the offices such as the furnitures, the hardware/software etc. (but these are one time expenses).

Our plan is to prepare a move with 2/3 more partners (which we are currently selecting) in order to be able to cover all the banking and finance (transactional ans regulatory) and Africa related issues, and generate a minimum of 2M€/annum as a start.

*** ESW FURTHER DILIGENCE 5/17/21:
I did a little additional digging on Zhun.  First, I spoke with Letao.  She confirmed that she recommends Zhun and believes that he made a mistake in deciding to join Offit.  She obviously cannot guarantee his book but she knows he has a very strong network in China and a good reputation there as well.  While his book has suffered due to a drop off in work from ZTE’s issues with the US government, she would be surprised if he didn’t succeed under Rimon’s model.

I then spoke with Jason Klein, who had worked at Offit.  Jason confirmed that it was “quite possible” that Offit’s back office messed up Zhun’s ability to docket patent matters, thus leading to Zhun’s frustration and desire to leave the firm after only a few months.  Jason stated that Offit did not have much of, if any, a patent prosecution practice and expressed surprise that Zhun would’ve decided to go there in the first place.  I think it might be helpful for Zhun to speak with Jason and have Jason provide us with his thoughts.",,"No, but agreement sent",LCQ Sent,Yes,Yes,Patent Counseling and Prosecution,Joined Rimon,"Keller, Justin;Klein, Jason;Moradzadeh, Michael;Qin, Letao;Wisneski, Ed;Xu, Jason",zcrm_1837424000018928484,"Per Letao 5/10/21: His book of business had been multi million dollars for many years. Last year it was only somewhat over 300k, probably due to a number of factors such as losing ZTE as a client and covid.

From Zhun, on updated numbers 5/17/21:
I looked over the numbers during the weekend and believe the 2020 collected fees from my originations should be adjusted to $837 for reasons listed below:
1. The $44k collected fees from my originations were based on the snapshot I saw on Jan. 12, 2021 and my last date with Faegre Drinker was Jan. 15 (Friday), 2021.  But I could not tell which client(s) paid those fees (as the combined Faegre Drinker firm, after about a year of integration (starting Feb. 1, 2020), moved towards a more ""closed"" system.         
2. As I was getting ready to change firms from the end of 2020 to the beginning of 2021, that $44k collection as of Jan. 12, 2021 could not possibly be from the work done in the first 12 days of Jan. 2021.  My starting day at Offit Kurman was Jan. 19 (Tuesday) because Monday, Jan. 18 was a holiday, and no longer had access to Faegre Drinker numbers after Jan. 15, 2021.  
3. Legacy Drinker's fiscal year used to end on Jan. 31, which was the basis for all my data provided for 2019 and 2018 (and the numbers mentioned for 2017 and 2016). But the combined Faegre Drinker firm shifted the end of fiscal year to Dec. 31, starting in 2021.  To be consistent with my 2019, 2018, and earlier data, the payment amounts arrived in Jan. 2021, should be accounted as a part for my 2020 originations.  
4. Assuming in the remaining 18 days in Jan. 2021 where the same payment amount of $44k came in to Faegre Drinker from my originations, then my total amount of collected originations for 2020 should be 749k (as of Dec. 31, 2020) + 44k (as of Jan. 12, 2021) +44k (as of Jan. 31, 2021) = 837k (or a little higher).

- There are really 2 claims, not 4.
- One claim relates to Benjamin’s role as a real estate entrepreneur in a project gone bust during the crisis.  These 2 claims should not be counted against him.
- The other claim has various serious allegations against Benjamin which, if true, would disqualify him.  On the other hand, there are enough underlying parts of the story that indicate that he was caught in the middle and was trying to be creative to come up with solutions to save a project.  I can’t render a conclusion without more facts.
- During the 2003-2007 time frame, the Mexican real estate market was very hot and everyone was making money (a rising tide).  However, when the crisis hit, a lot of projects that had bad management or were under capitalized or were just in weaker markets went under.  At the time, I was heavily involved with Paladin and we had 3 JV’s blow up and 2 went into very ugly litigation.  Our had several very ugly messes that took several years to unwind, including insurance claims, bail-outs and restructurings which required a lot of creative planning.  We also had disgruntled home and lot buyers who threatened litigation to try to recover cash deposits which developers had spent on permitting and legit capital expenses.

o	He is okay with a minimum floor of our share based on revenue of his firm. I don’t think we need to be too pushy on this. Maybe 5% or so. 
o	He is okay with our delineating the expenses to certain categories of expenses that Rimôn covers anyhow. (And maybe we can limit each one to a certain percentage of revenue?)
o	He is okay with our having veto rights over partner selection for qualified reasons.

It is after our meeting when I did some open source checks the following days that I became concerned about what I read. 

During our meeting, I did raise the point that having a consulting company with someone who was acting as an agent or business provider in Africa could be problematic in terms of compliance. We then discussed the fact that, according to her, Mr Chevalier could need to be paid in advance for bringing a new client (which is another compliance red flag) and I told her that the Rimon model was not one which was really fit for paying consultants (or even foreign attorneys) in advance if we were dealing with substantial amounts of money.

Therefore, she knows that we had some reservations but not the full extent of them since we made the readings on M. Chevalier, Georges Forrest and the Forrest Group on the following days.

""Given that I cannot guarantee any portable business should I be invited to join Rimon, I thought it might be helpful to set out my preliminary thoughts on building a book of business.""",V. Hired,"Yaacov's notes 5/16/21:
We have to assume that we would lose money on this candidate alone, and that losses will be bearable. So the real questions I'd ask is whether (a) adding Mike will actually help us recruit profitable lawyers in the UK and (b) whether Mike will actually stay if he can't generate business. We're obviously keen to suffer the same sort of fate as our competitors who have opened in the UK only to fizzle out pretty quickly.

Scott's reply 5/16/21:
1.	Roger and I think the trickiest step in building London is probably the first partner hire and starting to build a core.  Mike would obviously be of help with that.
2.	On costs,  under our Agreement we would be entitled to a £10k advance placement fee if Mike joins.  We never intended it to work this way if the first partner we placed has no day one book.  We are happy to waive the advance payment for Mike and rely on the 15%.  As regards office space, I’m pretty sure Mike intends to work remotely (he lives in Bath which is not a sensible regular commute) – I can check this with him if it would assist.
3.	On Yaacov’s questions -
(a) will Mike actually help us recruit profitable lawyers in the UK? The answer is that he is a first step.  If we recruit him, Petar and a couple of others we will have a nucleus which should act as a springboard.
(b) will Mike stay if he can't generate business – I think the real question is whether Mike will generate business – I wouldn’t expect anyone to stay if they can’t generate business.  There’s a reasonable prospect he will generate business but it’s not a slam dunk. If he leaves after say 18 months and has enabled us to build the office with other profitable lawyers in the meantime I don’t think it matters – building the office with other profitable lawyers of course does matter.

Roger's input 5/16/21:
I would like to think that as a start he should be able to seek to develop business and target the handling of matters without incurring such costs. I wouldn’t have thought that Rimon should invest in research tools and the like until a request backed by a business case comes forward. Presumably some types of support if needed eg paralegals and document management could be provided from other locations particularly the US? If yes, we can highlight this to Mike-I think I already mentioned this possibility on one of the VCs with him",,Yes,LCQ Received,Yes,Yes,Commercial Litigation,Joined Rimon,"Hyman, Katie;Moradzadeh, Michael;Parker, Roger",zcrm_1837424000015769157,"In final drafts of agreement, per Scott 6/7/21:

07/09/21:
The market is recovering slowly – I just got my first significant new business since the start of the pandemic today, hoping the trend continues. The risk for Chris is that he is extremely specialized. On the other hand, he could keep himself busy with just a handful of clients. Not a lot of cross-selling potential, so if that is the strategic focus of the firm at the moment then maybe better to pass.

I am also not 100% in - my personal cons are similar to the firm cons – my pros are that I do think we can co-market (tough to sell a practice group as a solo) and from a security perspective we could keep each other on copy on matters to have 4 eyes in case of unexpected interruptions.",All interviewers to reach out and set LA Zoom call,,,None,Almost none,,,Collaboration model;People in the firm;Practice/Sector expertise,,,,,Starts 7/30/21,,,,,,,,,,,zcrm_1837424000020815001,Piels,zcrm_1837424000020815061,Kimball,zcrm_1837424000020815031,Agah,,,1.8374240000198152e+18,,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He really sees himself establishing Rimon’s name in partnership with Rimon, even thinking about helping to open a Singapore office.

•	I know Bruce Marks and Alexey Sokolov fairly well.  Very doubtful that a counsel at their firm collects that much per year.  
•	Many Russian billionaires are on US/EU sanctions lists, US law firms can’t work with them.  
•	I have never heard of Sergei before.  It does not seem that he is admitted to practice in Russia (he may be registered as a PA/NJ lawyer maintaining office in Moscow).  If he is admitted in CA, his resume should be amended.

More notes, Dmitry 7/2:
I have finally spoken with the person who knows Mr. Bespalov personally.  This person is a lawyer.

He was surprised to learn that Mr. Bespalov is seeking a position with a law firm because he thought that Sergei is now primarily engaged in his movie production business (this is why Sergei moved to CA from Philadelphia a while ago).  My contact knows Sergei mainly as entrepreneur, not as a lawyer.  They have never worked together on a case/project as lawyers.

My contact knows the firm Marx & Sokolov which currently lists Sergei as their Of Counsel and says that, according to his understanding, Sergei is not actively involved in practice of law with this firm.  As the firm is not large, they keep Sergei on their website “for marketing purposes” (i.e. to expand the depth and head count of their capabilities).  

Re wrongful death aviation case, Sergei was acting more as an entrepreneur in that case (he saw the opportunity, went to Russia, organized plaintiffs and negotiated large settlement with the airline), the legal side of the case was handled by a NY-based attorney specializing on such cases (Steve Marks of Podhurst?).  Sergei’s first education in aviation engineering clearly benefited the case.

Re movie production business, my contact thought that Sergei’s role their, again, deals with business operations, not legal support.",,,"Russian billionaires, financiers, multinational corporations, families of passengers killed in plane crashes",Paralegal,About one full time associate,20000000.0,"Commercial Litigation;Corporate;Corporate and Business Transactions;International;International Transactions;Litigation;Mergers & Acquisitions;Sports, Entertainment, and Recreation;Other: see notes section",Compensation Structure;International/Regional capabilities;Management Stucture;Opportunity to be on cutting edge,,,,,"Also, we were not confident in his stated book",,,Indicated he would use a paralegal for some of his corporate and entertainment work.,Sergei would like to bring one associate with him to service his entertainment and corporate matters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.8374240000206116e+18,,False,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One other thing to consider:  Peter said that he had spoken with a partner (whom he indicated was a woman but did not identify her) who had left Rimon with a less than satisfying experience.  She had left in him the idea that he was giving up 30% of his compensation and not getting much in return.  I do not have an idea who it was, but Michael might want to think about how to confront that if we move forward with Peter.

Notes from Phil Q 2/14:
""I neither liked or disliked Peter. Not someone real easy to talk with.   I did not get a good sense of what he actually does.  Each time I thought we had it nailed down, he would say that subject area was not that big a part of his business.  He was very concerned about the money and thought the 30% cut was a big cut for the firm to take. He, mistakenly in my opinion, believes that big firms (his old firm) gave their partners 65% of the revenue they bring in. None of the rest of the table had ever heard of a big firm paying that much.  He just seemed to have misconceptions about what made Rimon different and also somewhat stuck in an old style practice with associates, paralegals, etc.  A lot of talk about what support he would have both lawyer and administrative.   Given what I understood about his practice we likely would not work together so he would not impact my practice one way or another.

Staffs' current salaries are:

* Foreign filing specialist / MY-JM secretary:   $91,000
* Docketing specialist:                                     $82,000

Can you please let us know :
(1)  How do we get paid in the first few months with Rimon, before our collections come in?
(2)  The specifics of Rimon's health insurance for the staff members (our staff all need spouse/family coverage), and
(2)  The cost and specifics of health insurance for partners and patent agent ( I understand that these benefits will come from our 70%).

Per recruiter 8/17/21:
Regarding Initial Financing, they are all going to need some compensation, a draw during the start-up period, probably a few months until collections start coming in.  I don’t know how much yet and they understand it will need to be paid back from collections.

Regarding Revenue Targets and Thresholds- I don’t know how you determined $4.2M to be their minimum.  It may have been from my original presentation to you, but since then there have been multiple meetings and LPQ’s for each reflecting a different range for the group in total.  They think $4.2M to be too high with anything under this subject to a prorated reduction in cost coverage for the office lease and support staff even though there is over $1.25M in revenues left for the firm.  And at $2.75M, Rimon stops paying entirely for these costs even though there would still be more than $800K in revenue generated for the firm.  I can’t argue with them, it doesn’t seem fair.  They are doing very well and on track to do over $5M this year.  There is no problem with your terms if all is going well, but they need to consider a worst case scenario as your firm does as well.  I am pretty certain they will need these thresholds lowered considerably, but I am not sure to what level for them to be comfortable to move forward.

I had three (maybe four) months in the low year that were dedicated to preparing to try a case in Judge Hoffman’s court.

We obtained a jury verdict of $6.6 Million, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees, and taxable costs, all of which the Firm gets about 30%. It was recently affirmed on appeal by the Dallas Court of Appeals. The defense says they will pursue a petition with the Texas Court of Appeals.

In other years, I had more billable time so the numbers are higher.

If I have to try the patent case against the government and its military contractors who are implementing security systems at military and civilian locations, including nuclear missile installations, the amount of time needed may be high, the risk will be high, but the potential benefits are also very high.

As far as I can see there can be no reason for them to move to a traditional firm for at least 3 reasons.  First, no traditional firm will offer them a combined salary of about $500K on $1M business (But Rimon can).  Second, the firm that they were/are considering has an abundance of environmental lawyers and it is unlikely that they will get too many referrals resulting in new business. (but Rimon can).

Bill is in his 80s. He is quite sharp and wants to work. Based on my understanding, his book is in the range of $2M. He wants to spend part of the year in his cabin in Montana and that is why your firm may be attractive. I also believe there is a chance that John and him can team up and John can leverage some of Bill's associates in Kansas City (and possibly some of Patrick's) while he plans his move to California.",,,,,See Notes,,,Lifestyle;Flexibility in billing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I originated all the work in Attachment A, and I did all the work on those matters.  And I currently have a 100% collection rate for the matters listed.  A reason for this is a big percentage of my state/federal white collar practice consists of flat fees up front, which facilitates collections immensely.  I do my due diligence before quoting a flat fee to a client.  This, in conjunction with my efficiency and experience, often results in a very high hourly in a flat fee case.  Quick example: let’s say I’m retained for $10k flat fee to research if a client’s business model contravenes bank and/or money laundering laws, and I only need to spend four hours on the matter.  The client is happy knowing there’s a top limit on what I’ll be charging, and I earn approximately $2500 per hour for the work I did.
Upon leaving my current position I’ll be bringing with me approximately $400k in portable business.  Further, I have two significant federal white collar matters I’m defending, both going to jury trial within the next 12 months as my clients have declined the U.S. Atty’s plea offers.  Each trial will generate fees in the vicinity of $350-500k.  Going with the conservative $350k figure, times two, that comes out to approximately $700k for the two federal criminal jury trials.  That $700k added to my $400k portable business I’m bringing with me accounts for the estimated $700k-$1m book.","Zheng: ""Very likely to be able to work with Manny Medrano in white collar criminal matters in CA""

I told him I don’t pretend to have the answers, but I thought in some ways he might have flexibility, for example:
•         If he can maintain the same billing rates at Rimon, could he establish appropriate internal billing rates such that “his” portion, after the firm’s share and whoever is doing the work, can fairly compensate him?
•         Related points: what do his team receive now in comp and what do they need? With our model, conceivably the team could work fewer hours for the same or similar comp to what they’re getting today.
•         Might there be other ways his team could be dealt with on “team matters”? For example, could they be a single economic unit for team matters and then he allocates comp as makes sense? There are challenges to this – including integration with the rest of the firm – but my sense is that, even if we assume his team bills “only” $8mm (less than what they did last year, and he thinks his group could be closer to 10 this year), the aggregate of $5.6mm is more than what the entirety of the team is getting paid now.

To summarise, if this works out, (1) we will drop McCarthy and we can move ahead with Rimon Law (2) we will maintain independence of the name of our firm in Singapore (no change) (3) given the synergy with Crowe and it will benefit Rimon too, we will keep this association.

Per WanHsi 8/11/21: In general, the Moroccan model works very well for us.

There seems to be two options, namely (a) “in association with Rimon” where we jointly market and have a fee share arrangement or (b) a referral fee arrangement. 

In relation to the first option, there could be a fee share arrangement where the “fees under management” principle would apply – the originating partner would manage the client relationship, send out the work once done, payments etc and receive a percentage / portion of the fees as agreed, while the partner (team) doing the work would invoice the originating firm for the agreed fees. We have found that this works very well for overseas firms that charge in USD, GBP etc because we would charge our normal rates in ZAR – the SA rates are generally lower than other jurisdictions and there is always headroom between what, for example Rimon, would charge its clients, and what we would charge to do the work. To make it work the other way around, we would discuss and agree a fee for the work done by the Rimon team, and we would add a BVI fee as agreed with the BVI client.

1. Jorge Arciniega - former law partner - Trained him from day one. Rami was a summer associate, then an associate under Jorge, from about 1994-2007. Also used Jorge while at Saban. Careful, thoughtful, trusted him will all top clients. In fact, transferred his book of business to him when he went in-house. Easy going, good communicator. He was good at managing people and projects, building consensus. Honest - not a crooked bone in his body.

2. Stephen Smith - Partners together at Greenberg - 2007-2011. Thought he was excellent.  He was de facto the most experienced partner in his area of expertise. Did great work. Always first choice. Everyone sent him work and trusted him. Great personality, made friends easily, works people well. Respectful of people's time.

3. Elie Dekel - President of Saban
Founder of Saban brands - Rami was one of the first hires overseeing legal activities. Company grew dramatically.

Mauro's current deal with CMS is a 70/30 split.  However, CMS fronts the costs of associate salaries (approximately 200k Eu) as well as his current office space.  He is interested in learning whether if he joined Rimon that there would be work that would flow to him in Italy from other Rimon partners in the US and elsewhere in Europe.

CMS is paying my associates (current annual cost is Euro 150,000, including bonus), office staff, lease/rent for the office, pc and basically I have no other costs to bear to run my activity. 

CMS office is in Milan downtown near the Duomo.

The remuneration charge for Rutsaert Legal (all employer’s charges and taxes included) for the financial year 2019 (1 Jan. to 31 Dec.)  will be as follows:
•	Edouard GUY (fully qualified lawyer): €53,971
•	Raissana BACAR (lawyer): €47,966
•	Nicolas DURAND (paralegal): €33,853
•	Caroline BOCH (secretary): €12,798
•	Serge DE CEUNINCK (accountant): €18,743
TOTAL: €167,331
Quentin estimates that for the financial year 2020, the total remuneration needed to serve a turnover of €600,000 (i.e. an increase of 11% compared to 2019) shall be around €180,000. This estimate is based on the following reasonable assumptions:
1.	the team remains unchanged throughout 2020, except that Caroline Boch shall become part-time (50%); and
2.	the salaries of Edouard, Raissana and Nicolas will slightly increase.
On top of the contractual remunerations described above, Rutsaert Legal grants bonuses once a year. For the financial year 2018, Edouard GUY received a bonus of €15,000 and Raissana Bacar received a bonus of €10,000 (all employer’s charges and taxes included).",,,,Paralegal;Secretary;Other: see notes section,,,,Compensation Structure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.8374240000075013e+18,,False,,,,Mutual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In as much as it would be “nice” to have an office in Mexico, I do not think it would be in Rimon’s best interest to open it with an attorney that does not have a book of business or a high level profile.  I’ve known Alberto Bringas for about 15 years and he is a capable but not a high caliber attorney plus, unfortunately, Hermosillo and the whole state of Sonora are not jurisdictions with high potential clients 
(I think there is only one publicly traded company in the state – Bachoco – a chicken producer, but its success was due to heavy political support as a former governor (Ricardo Bours) is a member of the family that owns it and a former very powerful senator from that state also had been rumored to have a stake in it).  And politically speaking right now, Sonora’s new governor is from the ruling Socialist party known as MORENA, not a very entrepreneurial, capitalist platform, actually, quite the opposite, so I don’t see Sonora being a place for foreign investment in the near future.

Marty is certainly a well known speaker and a smart guy.  I can talk to him if worthwhile, but 2 problems:
1.	Michael and I don’t have any bandwidth.  So unless someone else does, this is not a good fit.  I think trying to build that support is hard.  He hasn’t done it successfully himself, or else he would be bringing it with him.
2.	I believe he is in New Jersey or New York.  If most of his clients are in those states, he really needs someone licensed to practice there.

So, do we have bandwidth within the team? It’s dubious. Because of tax law changes, everyone is super busy. The question I would ask is what's in it for us as a firm. I guess if we could find an experienced Service Partner that Marty felt comfortable could do good work and didn't have much of a book of business themselves, then it would be a win-win for that partner, for the firm, and for Marty. Then it would be great. He is a smart and well-regarded guy, and would be a nice thought partner, as well as a prestige element, to have on board.

We worked together very closely for nearly a year on the privatization via IPO of the largest insurance company in Poland and also on a few high yield offerings.
•	Wayne is smart and articulate. 
•	Like many of us who came to London from NYC in the late 1990s/early 2000s, we rode the wave of American investment banking power and acquired huge experience in EMEA cap markets (high yield debt, IPOs, etc)
•	The world has changed and the relationships and skill sets of the UK-based US lawyer are not as relevant to the current landscape as they used to be
•	A lot of the EMEA investment banking has moved already from the UK to the EU
•	Even UK-based UK lawyers are having and will continue to have a diminished role in EU/EMEA deals
•	Investment banking deals in general are not what they used to be and the role of the US lawyer is less important than it used to be

Helping him to get over the line: I’m only thinking out loud but more information that shows how he would fit into the firm in reality would be reassuring. It could be good to speak to more partners who can share their experiences for example about going through a a downturn, or how they transitioned to Rimon with their clients - he’s wondering how his old clients will view his move and their move with him to Rimon/the new platform.  He’s spoken with his clients and some of them (who are older and perhaps more traditional) are a bit skeptical.  He’s also wondering about the plans for HK - it could be helpful to outline what your vision for Asia is and empower him to be part of the build out as an ambassador for the firm, thinking about how the office could grow, how to get publicity, etc. We have talked about the transition but if it can come from you, Michael, I think he could feel more confident and reassured.",,Yes,LCQ Received,Yes,Yes,Financial Services,Other,"Liu, Zheng (Jen);Monsanto, Lisa-Marie;Moradzadeh, Michael;Reilly, Andrew;Silberman, Yaacov;Ye, Xiaowei;Zuniga, Juan",zcrm_1837424000017544096,"Per recruiter, re: David’s book of business:

Sean remains extremely interested in Rimôn. He and Andrew discussed the biweekly attorney video meetings, and Sean loved the feedback. Sean then related to me how he once worked for a Master in Australia, a man named Cable, (who has since passed). He said many mornings, Cable would greet Sean by saying "" Mate, you did a great job yesterday at _____ "".  He would always recognize any good things or contributions. Andrew Reilly's positive rendition of his Zoom meetings greatly impressed Sean and so he wants to move forward. 

Sean gave me his numbers (without my asking him) as an average of 520,000 AED per month or about 1.6 M USD per year gross but this is in the absence of two major deals, one in Oman and one in Iraq. He has already completed the first level of work for these two deals. Oman (renewable energy project) and Iraq (another energy deal). He thinks he wants to complete the second leg of these two deals.

He said that the increase of his collections based from these two deals would be between 2 and 3 M USD over 2 to 3 years of work. This would bring his total generative ability to 2.5 to 3 M USD equivalent per year over that same time frame. When I asked him how long a wait that might be, he strongly implied he should know about those two deals within 2 weeks to 2 months. 

He told me also that his partnership agreement at Stephenson Harwood stipulated him providing a six month notice to Stephenson. But then he quickly indicated that to his knowledge there was never any problems or actions initiated by the firm against a departing partner who left before that 6 month notice period. 

He's meeting a finance partner for dinner. The finance partner is already reviewing material about Rimôn and told Sean he will talk with him about it. The finance partner is already talking to a similarly structured firm in Dubai (not Keystone) but he is now considering Rimôn and Sean will tell him more.",,,"Most of the corporate work comes from a small group of four large ultra high net worth family conglomerate businesses based in Oman, Morocco, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the UAE.",,,,,,,Reed Smith,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.837424000010574e+18,,False,,,,Candidate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Olivier's note 3/5/21:
Let me clarify the numbers:
•	The Swiss firm billed for CHF 2,343,268 ($ 2,545,000) last year, including around CHF 1,200,000 ($ 1,300,000) from my team. 
•	The US firm billed $ 676,287.20 
•	However, it included an amount of $ 640,424.68 paid by the Swiss firm to the US firm. 
•	In summary, the total of my team’s turnover was $ 1,335,000 in 2020. 
•	Because I am attending an LL.M. program, I expect this number will be a little lower this year. I plan to realize with my team a turnover of $ 1,200,000.

Yaacov: He still maintains a full-time office in Lausanne. We would not want to pay for this.
He still maintains a full-time office in Austin, at a cost of about $4,500/month. It has three offices and a conference room. And it’s just him! And he lives in a huge house, and he almost never sees clients. So query why he maintains and pays for this. We would not want to.
It would be a short avenue toward having an office in Switzerland, but I’m not sure it’s in our long-term best interests on these terms. To begin, we’d have no resident partner in Switzerland, just two associates, neither of whom has BD skills. We’d obviously associate Olivier with the office, but I’m not sure that he’s sophisticated attorney that we need to be our founding partner. He has basically only ever worked for one tiny firm before starting his own practice. So doesn’t have the years or depth of experience to be a draw to future partners. He also spoke about the mistakes he made in opening the US firm, admitting that he really didn’t understand the US market, etc. So he’s kind of neither her nor there.
Claim is that he has 1.2M business that was attributable to him last year. But he expects it to be less this year (I don’t know how much) and he said he really needs to undertake BD efforts to build a practice, etc.
If we simply a young and hungry Texas attorney, in some ways that might make an easier case. He likely has a decently solid book that can grow. But it might be a little harder to deem him a full partner. And harder still to use him for the opening of a foreign office. I worry about that the most.
 
If we can pull it off, I think my recommendation would be that we need him to bring an additional, qualified, local partner in Switzerland as part of the package. I already primed him for that.

**From Olivier 4/9/21:
In 2020, the turnover of my Swiss firm was composed as follows:
 
1.	My two Swiss associates and I made around CHF 1,240,000
2.	My partners (Danilo et Sylvain), who left the firm on January 1, 2021, made around CHF 1,054,000
3.	We charge our clients 3% lump sum out-of-pocket expenses for a total of CHF 73,000
4.	The total Swiss law firm turnover was around CHF 2,368,000
 
Therefore, my turnover with my two associates in Lausanne for 2020 was CHF 1,240,000, plus around CHF 37,000 out-of-pocket. Therefore, the total was around CHF 1,277,200. I expect to have similar numbers with my team this year. Of course, the turnover of Danilo and Sylvain is gone. 
 
This first quarter, our turnover with my two associates in Lausanne was around CHF 270’000. It was a little less than last year. However, I am attending a full-time LL.M. program at UT. Therefore, I am thrilled with these numbers. Furthermore, I expect to make more during the second semester, when I will have finished my LL.M. program. I expect to compensate the delta and reach my year goal, which is CHF 1,200,000.",,No,LCQ Received,Yes,Yes,Corporate and Business Transactions;International Tax;Mergers & Acquisitions,Chose to stay at current firm,"Bramwit, Melinda;Le Horovitz, Olivia;Moradzadeh, Michael;Oliveri, Sonia;Silberman, Yaacov",zcrm_1837424000054901200,"Additional recruiter notes 3/1/21:
•	He said he understands the support staff (3 or 4) salaries would come out of his 70% share he would receive from Rimôn. 
•	Olivier is confident that something could be structured so that his two attorneys in Lausanne Switzerland, practice under the name of Rimôn. The Swiss rule is that a foreign law firm can’t “own” a firm in Switzerland- but that he could name his group Rimôn and sign your contract, agreeing to the 70-30 revenue split, while not technically giving up “ownership” of the two attorneys in Switzerland. He is very confident that he can make it work with the Swiss authorities - he knows many people in authority.
•	His current status as a “foreign legal consultant” in Texas permits him to refer work to other U.S. admitted attorneys both in Texas or in NY or any other U.S. jurisdiction.  So he can “rainmake"" to other Rimôn attorneys until he passes the Texas bar this summer. 
•	He was very pleased to know that Rimon has a Paris office, and that according to your website, 9 attorneys in Rimon can speak French. He reminded that Lausanne is in the French-speaking region of Switzerland - many of his clients are French.",,"**I mentioned Danilo Delgado as one of my references in my Lateral Partner Questionnaire. Danilo left my firm on December 31, 2020. My secretary in Lausanne learned today that Danilo has breached his non-compete clause and has lied to me for more than 9 months.

Reed's notes on 3 other attorneys hesitations:

Here are a few topics that are of interest to this trio (#1 is of particular interest to them):
1.  internal marketing, cross selling, and related successes
2. firm awards/recognition in the patent area (in particular) and in the IP space (in general)
3. recent growth and growth trajectory (I have received very different numbers concerning current firm size)
4. firm “stability” (they seem a bit nervous since Rimon is relatively young) 

Further re: #1, it seems to me like Rimon has a very aggressive and well-defined internal cross-marketing program — e.g., your frequent internal calls, ‘speed dating,’ and face-to-face get togethers, etc.

Tania is likely the most hesitant of this group to make the jump. Jon was initially “all in“ but then seemed to become more nervous about the move after speaking with Tania. In my view, James is currently the closest to being ready to make the move.

My two largest clients have both slowed down a bit of late. To me, just the normal ebb and flow of business. To them, something of concern.  This may directly come up, but probably not.

They are aware of Rimon's typical fee split. As I think you know, I have been talking with them about a slightly different arrangement for the work they do for my clients.

Pepe sounds more Venezuelan than Mexican. The turmoil in Venezuela has resulted in massive migration to Mexico. Is that what caused him to move? If this is the case, his base might be rich Venezuelans who migrated-- that may be a good thing if he is prominent among them and if there are many if then. If he was not born AND raised in Mexico, he might be less likely to succeed in the Mexican environment. Who you went to school with matters a lot in the center of power, Mexico City or industrial hubs like Monterrey and Guadalajara.

Per JZ 9/15/21:
Agree in that Pepe is more Venezuelan than Mexican.  One element of his current pitch is that he has a lot of experience with helping families address the potential risk of keeping assets in country with a regime like AMLO’s Morena given that he had a lot of similar experience in Venezuela.  As for the Mexican pedigree issue, given that all of his career has been at Baker, he has mostly represented U.S. and multi-national clients and he has had success in porting many of them over to his current platform, so hopefully, the pedigree might be less of an issue.",,,,,,,,International/Regional capabilities,,,,,Was not ready to move - Submission by RCC - Will contact if moving forward.

-YPS pinged Lorne re: Goldman 12/15.
-Lorne response to YPS re Goldman: That shouldn’t be a problem unless we were suing them for fraud or bad faith or something like that. We normally treat lenders like Goldman, BofA, etc as neutral parties in our conflicts analysis on the theory that we are not really adverse to the lender because we are not representing the borrower on the loan docts or negotiating deal terms.   All we are doing is reviewing certain covenants in the Loan Agreement and checking the borrower’s organizational structure and organizational documents for the purpose of providing a reasoned opinion on the possibility of a substantive consolidation under existing bankruptcy concepts and case law. In my engagement letters I also make it clear to the borrower that we sometimes represent these lenders and may be opposite the borrower or it’s affiliates in matters unrelated to the transaction involving our opinions and get their consent to do so. If that’s an issue I don’t take on the assignment.  I will send you a copy of my typical engagement letter.

He says that despite being on track to originate $1M this year (in the previous two years it was $1.6M and in '19 it was closer to $2.6M due to two large class actions) the firm wanted to let him go because of his salary (he currently makes $600k) and the fact that he bills less than 1000 hours/ year -- opting instead to farm out work to other partners (26 in the past year).  He does first chair nationwide class actions but the two large class actions he had both settled in 2020.  He said that Drinker has a 1650 hour billable requirement and he has not billed close to that in a couple of years.  He also said that despite giving plenty of work to others at his firm, he has gotten zero in reciprocation.

This seems very odd to me.  Why would a firm not want a rainmaker who gives work to other attorneys?  Thus, this is a tough call.  He was very forthright and told me that everyone he knows cannot believe how ""stupid"" Faegre is being.  But it just strikes me as suspicious (even though he said nothing else).  If he were to join, it would be around 10/1/22.

Jason also indicated that he has close relationships with his clients but is not 100% sure his entire client base will follow him.  He said he will approach his clients in the coming weeks once he has a better sense of where he might be landing.

We need to make sure we retain the ability in the future to bring claims against/possibly sue Hiscox in the event of a claim (which could be non-appearance, terrorism, etc, we don’t know at this point, but not architects and engineers).

In their view, given the circumstances and the dollars involved, their view is that there is a “theoretical risk” that Rimon UK could be deemed to have a permanent establishment in Serbia, mostly resulting from Petar’s negotiating/contracting with clients of Rimon UK while based in Serbia. 

From a commercial standpoint, however, they say we should feel to proceed and we can check in down the line on how things are actually playing out, and whether it would be necessary to coordinate filings in Serbia. The tax effect of all this would be minimal to Rimon UK, but it would be a bit of an administrative hassle, in their words.

2.  As previously agreed, I am still keen to work as a consultant for NKO/PN at the same time which will help me boost my Rimon book of business. To that end, I would like to be in Zagreb and Belgrade for a few days in alternate months. Both cities I believe have Regus offices. Would I be able to make use of these offices whilst I am there?

3. My current notice period is 6 months.  Whilst I am confident that I will be able to reach an agreement with my current firm to leave earlier, I cannot guarantee this.

Even so, there is no strict ethical conflict. Roy only does minimal ($25k) tax work for two entities which are owned by one or more of the Getty Trusts (""Trusts""), not the Trusts themselves (which clears any imputed conflict). Roy is additionally unaware of any circumstance that would cause us to still recognize a conflict - i.e. whether the entities themselves are run by members who in turn run the trusts, as he doesn't have knowledge over who controls the Trusts.

To the extent Roy does further tax work for these entities next August/September, we can revisit and determine if a conflict waiver would be needed at that time. Frankly, we could probably get one from both the entities and Joe F.'s client Alice, as it is a situation where they'd probably be happy to have subsidiary entity tax work and estate planning under the same law firm ""roof"". 
Long story short, we're clear on Roy Gillig for now. I'll discuss with Joe F. as well. Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.""

Delta Dental is clear for now. 3D Systems Corp (as an adverse party to Ira's client) appears to be a conflict and we'll likely need waivers if Ira brings that over. Please feel free to discuss this need for a waiver with Ira (if he indeed ports over his client over) or I can do so, though this one is fairly straightforward.

11/4:
Client report appears clear.

Adverse report has some comments that Mileisy should review
 I'm not sure we'll be able to clear Delta Dental, though that appears to be the only one (pending response from Michael Ye).

Thank you for the continued interest in our firm. At the moment, only my team and I are ready to move forward – this does not preclude the scenario that other partners may be interested in sharing their information but at this stage, only my team and my practice are ready to move forward and keep the ball rolling. So, my communication going forward is on behalf of my practice only and is not on behalf of the firm.  Also, I want to make it clear that any information I am sharing will be and should be about my practice only, not about others’ practices or the firm as a whole (to this purpose, you will notice I am not copying anyone from Adsero in this email).  If Rimon is interested in other partners or teams, I am not at liberty to share and will direct your questions to the firm.  
 
Just to make sure we are on the same page, I informed Ian that I would be speaking with you alone.

My current book of business – after paying foreign counsel fees and third party vendor fees – is roughly $2M~$2.3M a year. It broke a million roughly 3 years ago, then $1.5M about two years ago and $2M last year. My group is currently the biggest revenue generator for the firm.  Attached below is the billing report screenshot in July 2022 --- the 1st column consists of people on my team, the 2nd column is the last month billing (subtotal in June for my team: $173,798), the 3rd column is rolling 12 month billing (subtotal: $2.26M), the 4th column is the 2022 YTD billing (subtotal: $1.363M) and the last column is “2022 annualized billing” ($2.337M).  My group is called: Asia Trademark Practice. Our group specializes in all aspects of trademark practices in Asia: clearance & searches, prosecution, anticounterfeiting and litigations (civil and criminal).

I am not counsel of record and have not done any work for the client for quite awhile.  I do not need to port Angel Technologies, and I can wrap up all representations.  Please let me know if you need more information.

* So CIFI won't need a waiver. John Murphy doesn't currently represent CIFI. If he does, then we'll explore it at that time. I'd just give John Islami a heads up, but this can be cleared. * Same for Engie. This is not a current client, so we'll want to give Robin Powers a heads up in case it becomes one later. 
*SMBC - TJH's email to Scott, ""There may not be a waiver needed on this, but..""

Per TJH's notes (2/21/23): 
John Murphy clients or potential clients:
o	BNP Paribas - we have a Rimon partner who is often adverse to large banks, including BNP. We'll likely need a blanket waiver here with respect to her work. Robin Powers - Rimon Law 
o	CIFI Latam - likely a conflict due to a current adversity to CIFI, though our matter should be resolved shortly. In which case, if John Murphy wants to wait until this matter is closed, we can discuss. Will need to run whichever pathway John Murphy prefers by the Rimon Partner.
o	Engie - not a current conflict (matter is closed), but it will be a conflict later this year. Engie does one matter a year (as an adverse party) with a client of Rimon. So we should know that a conflict waiver will be required (either now or later).
**John Murphy adverse parties
o	SMBC / Sumitomo Mitsui - waivers would be required as this is a client.
-----------------------------------------------------
R. Powers and BNP hit: We'll need a blanket waiver with respect to her work.
J. Islami and CIFI Latam hit: if this is active, then it's likely a conflict and we'll likely need a waiver unless John Murphy wants to wait until this matter is done (which we'd need to discuss with John Islami).
R. Powers and Engie hit: Per R. Powers, “It is not active at the moment. Engie does one transaction a year with our client.” - OK this is likely a conflict.
SMBC/Sumitomo Mitsui: Waivers would be required.
M. Kauffman and TMF hit: Not related to the same TMF. Marc’s TMF (aka Travis Manion Foundation) is related to CBS. - OK clear.",V.

Their practice includes patent prosecution, counseling, licensing and litigation (they consider themselves IP litigators, not necessarily trial attorneys). They have about 200 patent prosecution cases with about half active as well as U.S. and foreign trademark and copyright patent infringement and invalidity cases. Prior to joining, Lewis Roca, they were with Greenberg Traurig (New Jersey and Phoenix), McCarter & English and have also had their own firm. They appear to be very entrepreneurial and have innovative ways to practice and develop business. They are committed to staying in Phoenix as they see it as a future burgeoning area for IP. Their dissatisfaction with their current firm is that their billing rates are very high, there is little to no collaboration or support (which is what they were promised), poor integration into the firm and lots of committees and red tape.

Doug Lalone seems to be a perfect fit for Rimon. He is a true legal entrepreneur, who uses a business coach and data-driven analytics to attempt to increase his client base.

His practice is comprised of four buckets:  (1) IP procurement (registering patents, trademarks and copyrights); (2) IP litigation (he first chairs many cases and currently has cases in TX, NC and UT); (3) Strategic IP (counseling clients to keep the competition at bay); and (4) M&A transactional IP work (due diligence, buy/sell agreements).

He cross sells M&A work, cannabis and beverage/alcohol licensing work.  This work is referred outside of his firm.  Most of his inbound referrals come from non-lawyers so he is not concerned about joining a full-service firm.

Doug would need one full-time associate and a patent paralegal (only a few hours per week but that can increase depending on the status of his litigation matters).  

Doug has averaged close to $1.5M for the last 9 years, dropping to $800K last year but on pace for $1.2M in 2023 (he has added 10 new clients this year already).  His hourly rate is $650.

Doug is leaving his firm because there is a toxic cult of personality at his firm that he cannot resolve.  Many partners and associates have left the firm.  

Doug wants to move immediately (May 1) and I think he would be an A+ addition to Rimon.",,edward.wisneski@rimonlaw.com,"Trade secret, unfair competition, domain name, non-compete,copyright infringement claims",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serge is a '07 grad and moved through several firms as an associate. He started at Norton Rose in '07 and joined Stephenson Hargrove in '10 with the partner with whom he was working.  After two years at his second firm he went to DLA and that was a ""wrong move"" (he spent 14 months there).  He then went to Orrick and spent 16 months there before joining  HFW.  He was there for three years before joining his current firm Bignon Lebray.  He has been a partner there for the past five years.

Serge's practice involves banking and finance. His main banking client is the Bank of China and he represents other French and Chinese banks.  His practice is very busy now and he works with one full time associate who billed 1400 hour for him last year and is on pace for 1800+ this year whom he would want to bring with him to Rimon if he were to join.  He had a second associate who resigned last summer and he has been too busy to find a replacement.

Serge is happy at his current firm but his practice is more domestic than he would like.  He also feels like he is inadequately compensated and likes Rimon's international reach and compensation structure.  He also said his current firm is not good at cross selling.

Serge's book is $700k and increasing.  Last year he finished at $682K Euro.   This year he expects to exceed $700k.  All of his clients are portable but Rimon would have to get on approved panels for his banking clients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brian Keeler is a corporate M&A partner who has been with MLB (by way of Bingham) for many years.  His practice has involved representing funds (PE and others) in M&A and other corporate transactions.  

His two main PE clients are winding down.  He believes his clients going forward will be non PE clients and he will experience significant rate pressure (his current rate is $1515). 

Last fiscal year (MLB does September fiscal years) he did $1.765M.  In the first half of this fiscal year he has done $500k.  However, Brian said a lot of work coming from his non-PE clients (who again are winding down and will no longer be clients) is not recurring.  He couldn't say whether $300k, $750k or over $1M would be his numbers if he were to join Rimon.

Because his two main clients are winding down, Brian is at ""60% FTE.""  He has an 1100 hour billable requirement and he is on pace for 500 although he said he has a $400-550M M&A deal that is beginning and his hours will pick up.

Brian does not need an office and utilizes minimal paralegal support.  He does use associates and the amount varies depending on the size of his deals.  He said he has a hard time delegating work and likes to do the work himself.

Brian cross sells litigation (he has a class action suit based in London) and also other practice areas that are required for M&A deals (particularly tax but also ERISA, environmental, real estate).  

Brian says his work comes to him through referrrals - he has not marketed himself.

Brian said moving is ""less than 50/50"" and he would not move until at least September 2023.  He wanted a couple weeks to consider Rimon.

I am on the fence on this one.  Brian clearly is a good corporate partner but it is hard to know how much work he would port (and then generate) if he were to join Rimon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They do general trademark prosecution, tradmark/copyright disputes, anti-counterfeiting (some hourly, some contingency fee) and are one of 11 law firms that has an ""Amazon practice,"" that throws off around $300k/year in trademark work (used to be more). 

Jeff would like to increase the number of US clients the firm has.

Jeff said he is ""burned out"" and wants to have a clear succession plan (Jeff is the 100% owner of the firm and said he does not want to practice more than another 4-6 years).

The firm has a number of attorneys, many of whom have been with him for a number of years.  Some are W2s and some 1099s.  If he were to merge his firm into Rimon he would likely eliminate some people. 

This may be a good acquisition target for Rimon (particularly since we are speaking with a number of candidates with Italian practices) but I do have a few reservations.  Jeff being ""burned out"" being the most important.  Jeff's firm is set up like Rimon and he was very familiar with the platform.

Current hourly rates $955 standard, $765 discounted.

Holger says that the leaders of his current firm are ""in it for themselves."" His mentor has told him to look elsewhere and Holger has been doing so for 3-4 years (which is a bit disconcerting).

Holger clearly is an experienced attorney with big firm training.  The concern here is the wild variations in his book and the fact that even on $5-600k he said he needs 600-1000 hours of associate time.

Larry is a seasoned litigation partner.  He has been at his current firm for 15 years (H&K before that).  His book is consistently $1M and it is all portable.  His rates are in the $300s for some clients but most are $600-700.  He recently landed a client that is a R.E. group backed by PE who is buying up apartment complexes.  This will throw off a considerable amount of corporate work.

Larry would want to work 50% in an office but would not have to do so (he is in Boston so we have office space).  He does not use admins, paras or associates much at all.

Larry's firm is not being well-managed.  Partners that take home $500k are originating far less than that.  Larry knows he is losing $$$ staying at his firm.

Larry is going to consider whether to proceed (he said he wanted to take the weekend).  I think he would be a very strong addition to Rimon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have significant reservations about Mark Beer.  He was very nice and clearly has a ton of contacts but he does not seem to do any work himself.  He generates work throughout the Middle East (oftentimes through governmental contacts - he worked in Dubai for years) and hands that work off - some to his partners in Keystone (he says about $2-2.5M last year), and much to other firms like Kobre, Skadden, Covington, Cliffort Chance, Freshfields (around $4M last year).

He also opened his own Rimon-type firm in Kazakhstan.  He said he is looking to leave Keystone because they are pulling away from international offices and consolidating in London.

Mark does not seem to do any work himself.  HE said he worked for the Crown Prince in Dubai (named as a ""Dubai Future Fellow"") and then retired for awhile in his late 40s.  He is 50 now and wants to work because he enjoys it (he said he does not need the money).

He also knows candidate Rashid Gaissen (they both have created Anglo-Kazakhstan groups).  

Mark does not have US-based work.  He would look to join Rimon so that European and Mid-East Rimon partners could do work he generates from client contacts but it does not seem possible for Rimon to be able to handle this work.   He also wanted Rimon to consider folding his Kazakhstani firm (Seven Pillars) into Rimon.

Mark also offered Rimon to help build out Europe and the Middle East (he did not mention getting paid to do this, but I sense that would be coming).

I simply don't think Mark would be a good fit.",,,"Mark is a highly regarded commercial lawyer with considerable cross-border experience. He has been a judge; worked in-house; worked in private practice; built hedge funds; advised governments and run private- and public-sector organizations.

Prior to joining Farhang & Medcoff, Jeff helped open the Phoenix office of Jackson Lewis where he practiced for almost 15 years. Jackson Lewis is a boutique firm and because of changes in management, Jeff had to refer out a lot of non-L&E work. Jeff decided to join a smaller firm where the founders were old friends and where he would have more control over his business development and client base. Jeff does most of his own work with help from a paralegal. About 50% of Jeff's matters are employment related litigation (including wrongful termination and discrimination claims). The rest of his practice includes advice and counseling, practicing before the NLRB and some commercial litigation. His clients include medical practices, cannabis and wellness companies, multi-housing related businesses, technology companies and insurance companies (not insurance defense). He also represents a very large national healthcare company (DayTryp Health) and some high-level CEOs. Jeff's current challenge is that his clients need other support (corporate/transactional, commercial litigation, estate planning and tax) that his current firm is not able to effectively service.  He is realizing that his current platform doesn't make the most sense long term and will hinder him in growing his client base. Jeff's portable book is $600k and he is projecting $700-900k by the end of 2023. He believes he would be able to increase his current rates ($375-$450) and also use alternative fee arrangements on Rimon's platform. He thinks he may want to make a move by the end of the year but is not wedded to that and might consider moving earlier to the right firm.

Michael is a bankruptcy attorney (creditors) who represents banks and private lenders.  He has been at his current firm for 12 years and made partner three years ago.

3/4 of his practice is representing Customers Bank, for whom he handles all of their NY litigation.  

Book is around $800k ($600k is Customers bank).  Rack rate is $600, but he charges Customers $440 (may be able to raise some).  He does almost all of his originated work himself, utilizing associates for discrete projects and sometimes using paralegals for research.    He regularly bills 2000+ hours.

He has not cross-sold much but is very eager to do so.  He has handed off some tax and real estate work.

Micheal likes his firm and the attorneys with whom he works but is not happy with his compensation.  He very much likes the Rimon model.

That firm was insurance defense and they told him they wanted him to start an IP group.  Unfortunately, it is no longer working out as the bench is severely limited.  

Tony said while he works for money like everyone, that is no longer his driving focus.  He wants to continue working to keep busy and generate business for others.   He also wants more flexible hours.

Tony's rate averages around $500/hour.  He has one insurance defense case that is $450.   Tony has an associate that followed him to his current firm that he would want to sponsor.  

Tony also said he has contacts everywhere, including at Lumina, a $140B DNA sequencing company, where his former associate is now in charge of legal spend.  Tony would need patent prosecutors to land that work and Rimon partners could definitely handle (the firm currently uses Wilson Sonsini).   Tony's son also works at Bank of America and Tony is confident that he could get M&A work for our corporate lawyers from them.

Frederic is a corporate/M&A transactional partner in Paris.  He consistently does $1-1.2M in business.  His business is self-generated. 

His firm does not have a growth plan in Paris and he wants to join a firm with a clear French strategy.  It will be important for us to articulate Rimon's strategy, including what practice areas and industries we would like to grow in. He will also want to know how much work currently flows to and from France.  He currently has to farm out employment, tax and IP work as Foley does not have Parisian attorneys in those areas.

She likes that Rimon has a marketing team.  She was also very complimentary of Rimon's model and how it lends itself to a healthy work-life balance.

Frances generates almost all of her own work - it is transactional/project development, and her clients are companies throughout the world seeking to do business in Africa, and she is on pace to hit around $750-800K in originations this year.  Her rates are $550-650.  She does most of the work herself with the aid of her paralegal whom she would want to bring.  On some projects she utilizes another partner or an associate.

Robert Keeling has a unique practice. He co-chairs Sidley's e-discovery practice.  He and his team of four others (two counsels, two contract attorneys) are hired by companies facing antitrust matters brought by the government to be ""e-discovery counsel.""  He works in conjunction with other firms, who act as trial counsel (this is 90% of his matters).  Robert gets very little internal referrals from his Sidley partners.

Robert's matters are a ""sprint"" and are ""episodic.""  His team can be working 250 hours/month for 3-4 months at a time on a large e-discovery and then, when depositions start, trial counsel takes over and Robert's team is mostly done.  He can then go several months without the next ""big one,"" and his hours drop to around 50-80/months during those times.

For the large e-discovery matters, Robert often employs 70-80 contract atttorneys who do the initial doc reviews and priviledge logs.  He also utilizes sometimes 30-40 Sidley associates to do quality control on the contract lawyers.   It is this last piece that would recuire significant thought were Robert to come to Rimon.

One idea (T.J.) was that Robert could partner with another firm (perhaps based in the Midwest where rates are lower) who can do QC since Rimon doesn't have the manpower.

Robert says he is grossly undercompensated at Sidley and his mandated bill rate is $1,250.  This rate is pricing him out of being able to do smaller matters and is contributing to the episodic nature of his practice.

Robert would be a fantastic candidate.  There are many moving parts here and we will have several additional discussions as we proceed.  Robert is not actively looking to move (he's been with Sidley for his whole 28 year career and has spoken with only one other firm that was a nonstarter) and does not have a timeframe.  But he said Rimon's comp. model is the ""fairest"" he has ever seen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was most recently at Coinbase, having been there for eight months during a hiring spree but was laid off (3rd round) in January 2023.

Cody's boss, the Director of Security - Legal, remains at Coinbase.  The Director came to Coinbase from Facebook/Meta along with a number of other C-Suite execs.  The Director went on paternity leave soon after Cody joined Coinbase and Cody handled all security legal work.

The Director has specifically told Cody that once he lands at a new firm, Coinbase will provide a large portion of their $1.3M security budget to Cody.  As a floor, Cody's direct supervisor at Coinbase has promised Cody, as recently as two weeks ago, $400-500k in incident response work and $200-300K in security compliance.   There is a definite possibility that more of the budgeted amount could be sent to Cody's new firm as well (regulatory compliance, international security).  

Additionally, Coinbase's privacy legal budget is $3-4M.  Cody believes he and his new firm could capture some of that work as well.  There is also litigation and other regulatory work currently sent to other firms that Cody believes he could capture with the help of his new partners.

Cody also believes he could bring in 3M as a client.  Cody was secunded to 3M when he was an associate at McDonald Huges and when he left McDonald and joined Dorsey, he generated $800k in business from 3M.  Cody says he has many other prospective clients and intends to widely market his expertise upon arrival at a new firm.

One concern is that Cody has moved around a lot, although he had good reasons for doing so.  He graduated law school in 2008 and for the first few years in practice he was a contract IP consultant for start-up companies.   In 2013 he became the fourth employee at CyberSponse as Director of Legal Affairs and Patent Counsel.   After just over 2.5 years, Cody joined AmEx as an IT Risk and Security Manager.  

After 18 months at AmEX, Cody joined McDonald Hopkins as a data privacy and security attorney.   When he arrived, the managing partner told Cody they expected him to bill 2600 hours.  Cody left McDonald after 10 months to join Dorsey & Whitney in January 2018 as an associate.

At Dorsey, Cody was secunded to 3M where he made several connections and said he eventually landed $800k in privacy work for his firm.  Cody liked Dorsey and would have stayed but the firm cut his pay during the pandemic and he was billing 250 hours/month as one of the only privacy/data security attorneys.  As such, in January 2021, Cody joined Oracle and received a significant raise.

After 18 months at Oracle, Cody was recruited to Coinbase, where he stayed until being laid off at the beginning of 2023.  

Cody expects to be able to charge Coinbase $1200/hour and all other clients $750.

We will need to thoroughly vet Cody since he is coming from in-house and has made so many moves in his career.  But he very well may end up being a good fit at Rimon.",,,Cybersecurity: 40% Privacy: 25% Transactional: 25% Intellectual Property:10%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jim Coyle has been practicing real estate law for over 25 years.  He went to Chicago Law School, worked in a big firm for 18 months there, and then moved back to Atlanta where he joined a small firm.  He grew the firm to 20 people and that firm merged into his current firm in 2009.  Jim was tasked with growing the transactional practice at his current firm and it is now 40% of the total gross revenue of the firm.

The firm had a management change and Jim does not like the direction that they are taking.  Jim is looking for a firm that will engage his entreprenurial spirit.  He has a number of clients and cross sells a lot ($250k/year in lit, tax, trusts and estate, bankruptcy, etc.).  He likes that Rimon does not have an Atlanta office and would be happy to help the firm grow in that city.

Jim has a real estate practice and represents lenders, builders, owners, etc.  He also has a title insurance business within the firm that operates in Florida, S.C. and GA.  He would like to grow that into a national practice (at least in jurisdictions where lawyers are required to do residential closings.

Book is consistently $1.5-2M (although a bit down this year due to the market.  Rates are around $450, but he also charges flat fees for certain work.

Jim would bring a four-para team with him.  He wants an office for the team but does not need expensive office space and may be fine with a Regus situation.

I think Jim is a great candidate who can help us open and grow Atlanta.  I highly recommend pursuing his candidacy.",,,"commercial and residential real estate, commercial lending/finance, and corporate transactions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

David advises public and private sector clients on sanctions, AML, FATF evaluations, digital currency regulations and issuances (including CBDCs), government relations, and corporate compliance.

From 2018 to 2020, David served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Counter Threat Finance and Sanctions in the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs. As the State Department's sanctions chief, David led the Office of Economic Sanctions Policy and Implementation and was responsible for managing 25 sanctions programs for the Secretary of State, including Iran, Russia, China, and Venezuela sanctions. 

In the two years since leaving the State Dept. and joining DLA, David has developed a $1.5M book of business representing multiple international clients including Russia's largest bank, one of Europe's largest pharma companies, a sovereign entity, Greece's largest shipping company.

David's holistic practice runs the gamut of international trade, export control, managing risk/compliance and governmental relations. He has close ties to Israel, Dubai and the UAE and likes that Rimon has a presence in the first two countries.

His main concern is that there are Rimon attorneys who have the expertise to help him on his matters (relations with foreign leadership.  David knows Ivan Komaritsky from DLA and said he could keep him 30-40% busy.  He would also need partners with government, export control and sanctions experience.

David said that last year he had 52 separate attorneys bill time on his maters.

Kurt is a personable guy.  He is primarily an insurance coverage litigator on the carrier side (1/2-3/4th of his work).  The remainder is commercial lit. His insurance company clients are loyal and portable.  

For him to join, Rimon would have to be on his clients' panels and the rates are lower (mid-$400s).  This causes him to push work down to associates (he said his firm does a bad job of utilizing paras).  Kurt believes he gives about 600 hours/year to associates and 200/year to paras.

His rate for other clients is $800/hour but he is less sure what non-insurance company work would follow him.

His carrier clients do not generate much in terms of cross selling.

Kurt is thinking of leaving Nixon Peabody after 18 years because he believes the firm does not consider his practice area to be important.

Seth is a 45-year Steptoe ""lifer"" who is being marginalized because of age despite having a consistent $3-3.5M book.    Indeed, the last 20 years, Seth has averaged $2.5-4M.  Seth also set up Steptoe's Brussels offices.  His practice involves the Brussels and London offices and there are partners there who could conceivably also join Rimoon.

Seth's practice is niche -- dealing with EPA regulatory matters involving pesticides (TASCA, FIFRA).  He does some litigation as well but that is minimal.  

Seth bills around 1200 hours/year himself and utilizes associates (one mid level and a couple of junior associates) for the rest of his work.

Current rate is $1300.

Seth also set up a non-legal advice consulting LLC thourgh Steptoe and asked if Rimon would be able to do the same.  We said we could definitely work on that.

His wife is German and is the GC of Mars Candy.  Much of Andrew's clients are small and mid sized European companies doing business in the US.

Andrew said he wants to slow down and not bill 2000 hours/year.  He said that most of his work is policyholder side but that he is not beholden to that work.

Andrew said he does not expect much work to port with him but that he has a ""huge network.""  He thinks $300K will come with him and he can reasonably expect to do $500-800K in his first year at Rimon.  

Andrew is speaking to several ""virtual firms"" and has an offer from Practical.  He expects an offer from FisherBroyles soon.

He handles CERCLA, RCRA, toxic tort and other litigaiton matters.

Berj's main client is Henkel Corporation, which has endless environmental litigation.  While Berj is not the ""relationship partner,"" the client tries to give as much of this work to Berj as they can and has indicated they will continue to provide him with this work if he moves to another firm.  Berj consistently bills 2200-2500 hours which is not conducive to being able to market and grow his practice.  He has been asking for help from his firm for years and they are not providing any, so he is ready to make a move. 

Henkel should provide around $500-550k in work this year.  He has other clients as well.  The main issue here is billing rates.  Berj's rate for Henkel is $350/hour.  He indicated that there is room to push the rate into the $400s.  Indeed, because Lewis Brisbois is not providing Berj with help, Henkel often goes to other AmLaw firms such as Greenberg Trauig who bills the client a far higher rate.

Berj also does some insurance defense work and the bill rate is in the $250 range.  He is fine to jettison that work, other than one matter for Chubb, which I told him should not be an issue.

Berj is a good candidate, and the only issue is the billing rates.  If he can raise his rates on Henkel into the 4s, I would recommend continuing with his candidacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jura (pronounced ""Yura"") is a partner at Wilson Elser and good friends with Amy Baker.  She has a strong grasp of Rimon based upon her conversations with Amy.  She knows she will make more $$ and have more freedom to practice at Rimon.

Jura's clients come to her through her extensive insurance company network.  Many of her clients are referred to her by insurers when they deny coverage.  Other clients are through insurers when they agree to defend.  Many of these matters have an IP or technology component.

Jura is a litigator, but she does not vert much like to be a trial lawyer any longer. Mostly, she is a client manager at this point in her career.  She trains others within her firm to handle cases.  Most matters are in FL, TX, CA and NY (Jura is licensed in five jurisdictions).  She would need litigators who are able to handle many cases for her.  We spoke candidly that she may have to go outside of Rimon to other firms as there may not be litigators with bandwidth in the jurisdictions where Rimon has litigators and of course Rimon does not have litigators in every jurisdiction where her cases are.  This will be the main issue to resolve if Jura were to join Rimon.

Jura is a very smart and accomplished lawyer, and she was very pleasant to speak with.   
 She is considering Rimon because her current firm has frozen comp, and it is not providing the level of service commensurate with what she is paying for.  Her group is also losing partners. 

Jura could be a great addition to the firm, but we would need to work out her support needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Finalized most bills through end of July.
Attached is the Clio report for hours billed and unbilled since I started this firm with my partner, Mark DePaco.
Hours billed ~1200/yr., lower than hoped but given everything, acceptable.  When we started this firm, our target was 1200-1400 billed hours per year.  As I mentioned, 2020 was rough due to starting the firm and 2022/2023 I’ve spent a good amount of time training my associate and onboarding our non-equity partner John Ambrecht.  Ay my rate of $550/hr, that’s $660,00/yr.  I realize it’s on the low end but there’s no doubt in my mind the hours will resume to my normal of 1500+ once I join Rimon.
I was finally able to secure the report from Fell, Marking with some historical numbers, which I’ve attached also. A good picture of my normal.
The not great years were 2016/2017, the year we unfortunately lost our daughter.

Brad Goss – StL Real estate.  Very robust book.  He may want to come over with one or 2 service partners, Elizabeth Lum and/or Lisa Johnson (who has a decent book of her own).

Stephen Stitle and John Tanselle – Indy banking and finance.  The banking/finance practice covers various aspects including lender side finance (real estate and asset backed), banking regulatory and M&A. They went over to Amundsen from their predecessor firm of Krieg DeVault about 8 years ago but have been disappointed and not well supported at Amundsen.  Their practice is not compatible with Amundsen current direction and are a pick-up opportunity, but most likely as a group since they still practice in a fairly integrated manner.  

Other partners/attorneys in Indy that may be part of this group include:
 Debra Mastrian (employment), Carrie Hill, Keith Mundrick, Larry Tomlin (an influencer in the group and has his own book), and Martha Lehman.

There is another legacy group from a prior acquisition (Herzog Krebs) in St. Louis of which 2 partners remain – Dan Peters (general practice with a solid book current chair of StL office) and Gene Brockland (general litigation, probate litigation and IP litigation with focus on art law and copyright).  Similar disappointment with this group as they had hoped the firm would support the growth of their practices which was not realized.
 
Other opportunities include (note, we discounted all pure insurance defense litigators and those without a book) ---

Joe Demko – StL – solid tax and T&E lawyer.  Generates his own book which is healthy for this market ($600k).  Also does some banking/finance work.

Alan Farkas (Chi & Indy)  -- Aviation finance, including litigation.  Had prior successful solo firm before joining.  Practices with Brandt Hardy in Indy.
	

Brandt Hardy (Indy) – Banking/finance.  I’m not sure if he is partner of the larger banking/finance group.  Good smart lawyer – book unknown.
	

Carrie Hill (Indy)  -- financial services and healthcare.  Book unknown.
	

David Jose (Indy) – Healthcare regulatory.  Book unknown.
	

Joe Carlasare (Chicago)  -- described as an up and comer.  Commercial litigator and crypto fintech nerd.
	

Linda Pence (Indy) – Robust white collar and investigations practice.  Very well connected with a solid book.  Publicity wise, this would be a coup in the local legal market.
	

Madalyn Kinsey (Indy) – Banking/finance.  Not well know to Sanders.  Ask Finger.
	

Mark Wenzel (Indy) – BK/creditors’ rights.  Solid lawyer – book unknown.
	

Martha Lehman (Indy) – Banking/finance, BK – works with Wenzel.
	

Suzannah Wilson (Indy)  -- Healthcare regulatory, employment.  Book unknown.
	

Suzanne Newcomb (Indy) – Employment. Book unknown.
 
James Sanders notes that there is nothing like Rimon in the local market.  To the extent any of these lawyers would be thinking of a move, their options are simply to trade one big law (regional law) traditional platform for another.

Ellen has been at her firm for 19 years.  The firm (400 lawyers) is about to merge with a firm of 800 lawyers.  She is not sure how it will work and thus is interested in exploring options.  She spoke with MBM in 2017.  

Ellen's revenue over the past 3 years totals $5.1M.  She has a large team of sophisticated attorneys, paras and engineers - so large that she said she could handle all of MicroSoft's patent portfolio if needed.  The problem is that if she leaves her firm, she may lose 1/2 of her clients (she seemed convinced she would lose her European clients).  That would leave her with, conservatively, a $500k book while she rebuilds.  She does not want to lose any of her team, which she says took years to build and would not be easy to rebuild.  The main question as to whether this could conceivably work is if Rimon partners are handing significant Chinese patent work to outside firms.  If so, Ellen's team could do this work while she grows her practice.

Ellen has known Rich Lee for 15 years and they have always wanted to work together. 
 Rich, who has his own firm - Cohorizon Intellectual Property Inc. has his own firm that does around $1M.  He also has a team of approximately 18 (lawyers, paras, engineers).  

Not sure if there is a fit here.  They are going to get us more information on their revenue, team size and OPEX.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neal Levin is a highly energetic and engaging global fraud, intelligence and asset recovery partner candidate.  One look at his web bio and LinkedIn profile will tell that to you.  

He has ""one foot out the door"" of his current firm, which is merging imminently with SGR.  He was unhappy before the merger talks and now is 100% committed to leaving his firm.  He is interviewing with other firms, including European firms that are opening offices in the US.

Neal currently resides in Chicago, but wants to move to NYC, and wants utilization of office space there.

Neal's team (which includes his ""lieutenant,"" who is an attorney, an intelligence officer, a paralegal and an administrative assistant) has worked on dozens of global fraud matters, chasing down fraudsters and recovering assets for his domestic and foriegn clients.  He is a ""tireless marketer,"" and is a member of many international groups, including one that promotes playing street soccer.  He is a very big soccer fan and devotes much of his free time playing, coaching and pushing Americans to embrace the international way of teaching kids how to play.

Neal mentioned that there are other partners (corporate) that are unhappy with his firm's pending merger.  Additionally, he works closely with a small DC based fraud/asset recovery firm that Neal believes would be interested in joining him at his next firm.

Neal had a ""down year"" of $1M as he spent time marketing and working on other endeavors but said he and his team are on pace for $3M this year.

Emilio is Argentinian, starting his legal career in one of Argentina's most prestigious firms.  He was secunded to Cleary for seven months, which has turned into 17 years.  During that time, Emilio started in New York, moved back to Buenos Aries when Cleary opened an office there, and moved to DC when Cleary closed that office.  He is considering a move because he wants to be able to continue to represent his US and LatAm clients while having the ability to live in Argentina one day.

Emilio's LatAm practice involves capital markets, finance, IPS, project finance and  restructuring.  One issue he will have if he joins is whether Rimon is on certain bank's panel of approved law firms (or can get on those panels). 

Emilio also is in the US on an H1B visa.  He expects to get his green card in the next year or so.  Would Rimon sponsor him?

Emilio believes at least $1M in business will follow him.  His clients have spun off international arbitration, restructuring, project finance and other work.

Brent is a VERY personable guy and seems like he would be a fantastic fit for Rimon.  He has a strong corporate practice where he often acts as outside GC for dozens of companies (many of whom are tech companies).   He has Biglaw experience (Weil, Squire, Akerman) and has started his own firm.  

Brent has a contract attorney (10-20 hours/week) a COO (he asked about whether we could bring on a ""business development"" partner) and an admin/para.  Not sure whether he would want to bring them all into Rimon, but he did inquire as to whether conceptually we would want to hire a bus dev. person and a legal assistant.

Brent does occasionally bill by the hour but most of his work has converted to flat fee billing.

Brent consistently collects between $1-1.5M and is considering joining a full-service firm to capture cross-selling opportunities and also to lessen the administrative burden.

Brent asked whether if he joined Rimon for marketing purposes we could announce that we had acquired his firm ""CoreX.""

Brent did not have enough time for a full conversation, but he had already submitted his LPQ.  The numbers work and Brent seems like he would be a fantastic addition to Rimon.  I highly recommend pursuing his candidacy.

Finally, Brent mentioned a Tampa IP group to whom he gives work and who is also looking.  He said he may make an introduction to us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Howard is personable and confident and does most of his own work.

He has tried to rectify this discontent, but firm management is not receptive, and Howard has been told he will not make partner there.

The firm was founded in 2003 as a spinoff of an other IP firm.  Don is an IP litigator.  Pete is a senior partner who has practiced in big firms (and set up Shook Hardy's IP practice).  The firm has a comp model ""similar"" to Rimon's.  The partners take all of collections and share in the cost of overhead.  Income from paralegals/patent agents/associates is considered ""shared income"" and is applied first to overhead.

The group's rates are $600-750/hour and they do discount rates 10-15%.  They said they would be willing to modify their rates to be aligned with the firm they would join.

The firm has experienced attrition and revenue is down.  In '21 the firm collected $2.8M.  In '22 the firm collected $2.4M and this year they are on pace for $2.0M.  They would like to keep their group together.  They think joining a full-service law firm with a deeper IP bench is essential.

Other than the significant office lease expense, the firm's remaining OPEX is minimal (less than $9k/month).  Nevertheless, Don and Pete were not deterred by Rimon's 70/30 split, stating that gaining stability and the ability to service more client work should offset the OPEX discrepancy.

Don and Pete both seem like quality lawyers and if we can make the numbers work they should be an excellent addition to Rimon.  They are currently speaking with several other firms (Rimon was the first firm with whom they spoke).

Neil Di Spirito is based in Orlando and runs a sophisticated FDA practice.  His practice has morphed over the years from representing large pharma clients such as Pfizer in large litigations (70-75% of his practice at the time) to representing smaller and mid-sized firms ($600mm) in licensing, transactions, FDA advice and counseling and administrative hearings, critiquing applications, supply chain issues, biologics, pharmaceuticals, etc.  10-15% of his practice remains litigation.  He has also written a textbook, entitled ""Bringing Your Drug to Market.""

Ed left Brown Rudnick recently and is in the process of setting up his own shop.  He said that the firm wanted him to have a much larger book (""a 2000+ hour practice"") but refused to provide him with the resources to do so.  They are paying him through December, but he is no longer on the firm's website.  He said the agreement was ""mutual,"" and he had been planning to ""get off the big firm treadmill"" for a long time. 

Neil has moved firms in the past few years, having had stints at Ballard and Epstein Becker before joining Brown Rudnick.  He now wants to go solo or join a firm like Rimon.

With his current practice, Neil would not need a ton of resources.  Neil said he would need a subscription to the Westlaw ""Pharma Page.""  He also speaks at and attends a number of conferences and is part of the FDA Institution, which requires a subscrition fee.

Neil does not need an office.  He uses about 400 hours/year of associate time and rarely uses paralegals.  He does however rely somewhat heavily on a legal assistant because he still dictates his work (there is software that could help).

Neil has cross-sold Corporate, IP, reimbursment, government contracts, environmental and transportation matters.

I liked Neil, and while there is some concern over him leaving Brown Rudnick before joining a new firm, this is outweighed by his obvious expertise and his understanding of what he wants (out of Big Law).

James is a fund formation/M&A lawyer who works in funds but also enjoys doing M&A transactions.  He started at Skadden and in 2014 went in-house to Credit Suisse, handling private fund formation and downstream investment work.

In 2022, Credit Suisse was experiencing what are now well-known problems and James moved to Goodwin with the idea that he would start his own practice there.  The problem is that they set his rate at $1400!!! and the rate pressure is the main reason he is looking for a firm with a saner platform.  James is confident he could bring $400-500k with him to Rimon and he could also handle overflow work from other funds partners.  He also would like to continue to be involved with M&As. 

James does most of his own work (he said he uses about 1/3 of a secretary's time).  He would like to have shared office and conference room space but that is not a deal breaker.  He is interested in moving sooner rather than later.

Brian Keeler is a corporate M&A partner who has been with MLB (by way of Bingham) for many years.  His practice has involved representing funds (PE and others) in M&A and other corporate transactions.  

His two main PE clients are winding down.  He believes his clients going forward will be non PE clients and he will experience significant rate pressure (his current rate is $1515). 

Last fiscal year (MLB does September fiscal years) he did $1.765M.  In the first half of this fiscal year he has done $500k.  However, Brian said a lot of work coming from his non-PE clients (who again are winding down and will no longer be clients) is not recurring.  He couldn't say whether $300k, $750k or over $1M would be his numbers if he were to join Rimon.

Because his two main clients are winding down, Brian is at ""60% FTE.""  He has an 1100 hour billable requirement and he is on pace for 500 although he said he has a $400-550M M&A deal that is beginning and his hours will pick up.

Brian does not need an office and utilizes minimal paralegal support.  He does use associates and the amount varies depending on the size of his deals.  He said he has a hard time delegating work and likes to do the work himself.

Brian cross sells litigation (he has a class action suit based in London) and also other practice areas that are required for M&A deals (particularly tax but also ERISA, environmental, real estate).  

Brian says his work comes to him through referrrals - he has not marketed himself.

Brian said moving is ""less than 50/50"" and he would not move until at least September 2023.  He wanted a couple weeks to consider Rimon.

I am on the fence on this one.  Brian clearly is a good corporate partner but it is hard to know how much work he would port (and then generate) if he were to join Rimon.",,,,400.00,,,,,,,,,,,"89 Meadowbrook Road, Needham, MA 02492",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Keith and Gary each have about $1.2M in business.  There are also two non-equity partners, one has about $200k and the other $50K.  The team also includes a paralegal and an assistant who would likely join.  

Group primarily practices T&E.  Keith's book is made up almost entirely of T&E.  Gary's book is 1/2 T&E (and some corporate work he does himself) and 1/2 cross sold - his clients spins off a lot of work outside of that area, including corporate, employment, tax, ERISA, litigation and IP.

At their current firm, the two non-equity partners do work for Keith and Gary but also many others within the firm's T&E group.  Thus, they would not necessarily be fully busy if they group were to join Rimon.  However Keith and Gary believe they are leaving a lot of work on the table which might be enough for both non-equity partners.  Both have ""a ton"" of client contacts and are both said they too busy to bring on additional work.

Gary and Keith each bill about 1200 hours/year (Gary says $300k is his own work, $300k is delegated and $600k is cross sold; Keith said his book is 1/2 his own work and 1/2 delegated.   

They said they have another 3600 hours of work to give to others (so I think if the two non-equity partners come, they would have enough work).

One issue may be rates.  Keith's is $515, but Gary's is $350 in Southern Illinois and ""a little higher"" in St. Louis. 

Keith and Gary are considering a move because some of their partners are ""toxic.""  Associates and others come to the firm and quickly leave because of this.  Additionally, the firm's comp model is a ""frustrating black box.""

I think this could be a good addition for Rimon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ted Roper has been practicing law for 40 years.  He has prior BigLaw experience (Kelley Drye, Hogan, McGuireWoods) and joined his current  regional firm in 2009.  He made that move because he hated BigLaw politics and bureaucracy.   His current firm is about to merge with a BigLaw firm which is why he is considering a move.

Ted's practice is Japan-centric.  He is a corporate lawyer and acts as outside GC to a number of Japanese corporations and also US subs of Japanese corporations.  He also represents high net worth Japanese individuals.

Ted cross sells litigation in numerous jurisdictions (Mississippi, NY, CA, Chicago, Detroit), but has not done so recently because litigators at his current firm have dropped the ball a few times (and some litigators have left).  He also is involved in an IP matter in Paris (working with French counsel) and an arbitration in Sweden.

Ted's book is approximately $800k and his rate is $685.  He has a longtime paralegal whom he would bring with him to Rimon.  I think he would be another great addition to the firm and his practice would fit nicely with David Case and Harold Nathan (who is joining in a couple of weeks).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He is based in Connecticut and is also licensed in NY and NJ.  His matters spin off a lot of litigation, particularly in NJ so he would need a NJ litigation partner that he trusts.  He also has employment matters in California and would want to work with a partner who handles such matters (Bob C.).  

Sami was admittedly conservative as to his book (he said $500-600k but last year he originated $740k and his receipts to date are already $488k).  His rates are in the mid $400s (some clients as high as $500). 

The rates are a bit low, but Sami was a very nice guy and culturally would be a good fit at Rimon.  He is considering his options and wanted to wait a couple of months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They all do general corporate work and commercial contract negotiations.  Kelly has franchise expertise and several of the team has M&A expertise as well.  Nick also represents the Illinois gaming commission (a long-standing client).  Switching firms will take some time as the Commission must have sign-off.

The team has been practicing corporate law together for many years and are a team.  They also have a full-time paralegal, Jeannie Ha.  

The team was together at Faegre for many years and in January 2021 decided to join Fisher Broyles instead of Rimon.  They now believe they made a mistake.  Fisher is not allowing them to add to their team (they wanted to add a Kirkland tax partner with expertise in fund formation and the firm would not allow it even though the team would pay for him).  They also wanted to add a former colleague, Tiffany Chen (who was with the group at Faegre but joined Sidley) and the firm again demurred.

The team knows Rimon's model and loves being in a distributed firm.  They are currently set up as a 1099 through an entity called ""Steppingstone"" and would maintain that entity upon joining Rimon.  Jeannie (the para) and Randy S. would likely join Rimon as W2 employees so as to qualify for benefits.

The Team understands that Rimon takes 30% (vs. Fisher's 20%) but believe the true percentage difference is closer to 3-4% based upon the depth and breadth of services Rimon provides vs. Fisher).  They are more than willing to give up that small percent.  

The team does need a database (Athenian) which may cost $30-50k, which we told the team would be part of the 30%.  None need a physical office location.

They do not need office space.

They indicated a 1/1/24 start date (they will be receiving additional significant (1000+ hours) work from one of their clients in 2024 and want to be able to services that work with a full team in place (including the tax partner and possibly Tiffany Chen).

Jake started his practice as a commercial litigator with Boise Schiller, then moved to Hunton Williams. He was then recruited to White & Case Japan (he is fluent in Japanese). There his practice expanded to international arbitration and multijurisdictional disputes. 

At White & Case, he also worked under David Case for a number of years. The work included representing Japanese companies in disputes with foreign companies abroad or representing foreign companies with disputes in Japan. He also did Forex investment for a year and worked as senior group counsel for Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore with their private equity group. In 2018, he returned to Miami to restart his litigation practice. One of Jake's largest clients is a Venezuelan cargo company.

Mengmeng is a superstar associate candidate.  She is engaging, earnest, eager to learn and is already INCREDIBLY engtreprenurial.  In her first year at her original firm she originated $700.  Last year, she originated $275,000.  This year, she is already over $600,000!

Mengmeng is a litigator (primarily commercial and product liability) and is interested in learning white collar and IP litigation as she has brought in matters in each discipline.  Her clients are Chinese and she has developed deep connections with them.  The WC case is generating $110k/month at present, and the IP litigation matter has already generated $130k.

Mengmeng is looking to leave her current firm because they are marginalizing her and not acknowledging her originations.  Partners are also trying to steal her clients.  She is looking for a firm where she can team up with and learn from partners but to maintain and grow her client relationships.  She also was very excited by the proposition of joining a firm with an esstablished China practice.

Mengmeng understands that since she has only been practicing for five years that she would have to join Rimon as an associate but would want to be considered for partner as soon as it made sense.

This is one of the most fascinating candidates I've interviewed.  I highly recommend trying to get her to join Rimon!",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ed and I just got off an hour-long call with Gabor. My notes and observations:
•	Looking for a full-time role that pays ~$300k
•	Ed started the call with a good 15-min summary of the firm and its business model. When he asked if Gabor had any questions, Gabor immediately went into the importance of templates and automation to law firm business models. I mention this for two reasons: (i) It came off as a general lack of knowledge of expected social scripts, but also (ii) that he has a background and passion in making templates and automating their use.
•	Regarding templates and automation: his undergraduate degree is in mechanical engineering and from that has a programming background. He claims that at his previous firm, he custom built tools (in Python) to automate docs. Now I don’t know if custom building tools is the right path over using off-the-shelf tools, but it shows some skills to which we rarely have access
•	Has a strong tax background! Before going to law school he became some sort of certified tax preparer (enrolled agent??) and has worked on corporate, partnership, and nonprofit tax returns
•	Has worked with a variety of partnerships, LLCs, and funds. When I mentioned Nicole’s practice he mentioned he worked on launching two crypto hedge funds
•	Has helped a client navigate an SEC audit (roboadvisor) where a big part of it involved SEC-disapproved hedging clauses all over the IAA, terms of service, website language, etc.
•	Has Series 63 and 65 certifications (for what that’s worth)
 
In short, I think he has some unusual skills that could fill some gaps. But I wonder what it is like to work with him. As noted above, he didn’t seem to follow what (in my mind) is the “right” script for an interview. Obviously that could be for a variety of reasons, some fine and some not. I also note that he is undergrad 2003 and JD 2007 (both in Hungary) with US LLM in 2012, but the first law firm job on his resume on LinkedIn is his June 2021-October 2023 stint at Haynes and Boone, so unclear how much law firm experience he has.
 
I don’t think he’s someone to whom we can hand off projects, but he could well be someone that can do a lot of the odd work in fund projects that general corporate associates can’t, such as getting into the weeds on tax or securities law issues, really vetting allocation or distribution waterfalls, or preparing templates or automating them.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He utilizes other attorneys who practice in real estate, tax, corporate and IP (trademarks).  

Rack rate is $595 but he usually bills clients between $500-550.  He likes to come into an office 2-3 times/week, which shouldn't be a problem as we are opening in NYC soon. He uses about 100-200 hours/year of associate time (but depending on the project could be other partners or a paralegal).

Mi-Yong works part-time (about 15 hours a week); she plans to continue that schedule. Prior to joining LimNexus, she retired from government service where she spent most of her career in the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the U.S. Dept of Commerce in senior level positions and then spent a couple of years as Counsel at Bass Berry & Sims.

Mi-Yong is not completely comfortable yet about moving to another firm so quickly (3rd firm and at this point in her career) but enjoys practicing with James. She also wants to hear more about how the internal marketplace works in practice, not just theory. She has been a frequent speaker on export controls and previously wrote several blogs. She is interested in doing both of these things more if she ultimately comes to Rimon. Both would nicely highlight the firm's international trade practice. Mi-Yong is brilliant and witty and would be a great fit in terms of experience and practice. We should do all we can to win her over.

James Lin is an IP litigator.  He started at Fenwick & West and moved to Orrick where he met Zheng Liu, Matt Poppe and Mike Heafey.  

James left Orrick with other partners who wanted to represent patent trolls.  But the firm they went to was unable to handle antitrust work James obtained from Acer (his main client).  James left to start his own firm and grew it to 15+ attorneys.  When the Acer cases settled, the firm shrank to its current four partners.  James does not believe his current firm is a good fit any longer.  He continues to represent Acer (he projects $1M in business) and he also has other clients including a semiconductor company and an oil & gas company whose GC is James' brother.  The oil & gas company will have full service needs and James is poise to get all of the work.

James was soft spoken and he revealed that he had been out of work for 3.5 years because of a medical issue.  He has been back full time for the past six months and he said his practice is booming.

I think James could be a good fit with the firm, although I'm a bit concerned as to how he has been able to build a book that quickly after that long of a layoff.  We will need to carefully review his LPQ.

James said he has other offers (I know he had been speaking with FisherBroyles) and wants to move in February '24.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to joining K&L, he was a partner with Troutman Pepper.

Jeff has a transactional practice that focuses on the development and financing of energy and infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on renewable energy project development.  His areas of expertise include solar, wind, geothermal, hydrogen, LNG, hydroelectric, biodiesel, and fossil fuels.   This solidly makes up about 80% of his client work.  Other work is a combination of construction, mining, P3, basic corporate transactions and a small niche of contract review for telecom companies.  Jeff's current billing rates are $1050/hr and $1200/hr which he wants to lower.  He does some work for his firm's institutional clients and other colleagues, but the bulk of his book is made up of clients that he has originated and self-services.  He expects almost all of his clients to follow him.

One of the reasons Jeff joined K&L was the collaborative atmosphere. Over the last two years, there has been a steady trickle of partner departures from the firm and his practice group including two practice group leaders and several rainmakers.  It has left him feeling like a lone wolf.  There were promises to rebuild, but that hasn't happened. In addition, Jeff has grown weary of the constant BigLaw bureaucracy and hoop-jumping. He has even experienced clients pulling matters because of the difficulty and time delay (over 2 weeks) to get new matters opened at his firm. 

Jeff was very pleasant to speak with and seems to be interested in making this move for all the right reasons. His energy practice would be a great addition and his desire for community and collaboration is also a good fit.

Nicoleta seems to be a superstar.  Born in Muldova and fluent in four languages.  Seh initially worked in government to ""save the world,"" but eventually join Greenberg Trauig and was there for 16 years before joining her current firm.  She is based in Geneva but is NOT a Swiss lawyer.  She is licensed in NY and DC and is a European and US citizen.

Her practice involves large, complex matters, mostly complex asset recovery but also sanctions, international arbitration, internal investigations, etc.  Her main clients are governments, but she also represents several multinational corporations.  On principle, she does not represent oligarchs in sanctions matters.

Nicoleta has built a $2M practice and has hit a ceiling at her current firm, which is not supporting her the way she would like.

Nicoleta wants to continue to live in Geneva for at least the next 18 months, but she has toyed with moving back to the US at some point.  Her practice takes her on the road a lot - she often in the UK, Australia, NYC, Italy.

She does not need an office.  She does need lawyer support (be it partner or associate), probably over 3000 hours/year.  By example, in September '23 she utilized 20 attorneys in five offices.  She has a referral network that she can continue to utilize, but she would love to find RImon partners and/or associates, both in the US and in Europe, with whom to work.  She also might want her own associate, which we should discuss further.  She also outsources work to intelligenc/investigator firms in her asset recovery work.

I liked Nicoleta personally very much and she is clearly a top practitioner in her field.  We should definitely pursue her candidacy.",,,"asset recovery, sanctions, international arbitration, internal investiation.",,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mainly she creates and performs due diligence on commercial leases and negotiates contracts.  She also has low-rate GL matters that she said she would not seek to bring with her to Rimon.   Rates for leasing work is $450 and she indicated she could raise them when she moves.  Book is $2M, but without GL work it is around $1.2M.

Nancy does not need an office and uses very little legal assistant work.  She does use about 3/4 of an associate's time and has an associate with whom she currently works that she would consider brining with her.

Gary couldn't confirm Harvey Oringher's reason for direct exit, but guessed it was a buy-out and a strategic decision to keep him on as Of Counsel. 

As a further clarification for the greater team, the two lead partners here take home appx. $7-8mm/annum combined. So while we'll certainly want to see their financials to understand their net and who gets paid what (including the rest of their attorneys), this potentially puts the appx. acquisition comp package from other firms at $15mm (i.e. assuming $24mm, which is 3 years of guaranteed comp for the two lead partners, less the $9mm AR balance). I can't directly confirm this $15mm number with Gary just yet as he hasn't heard hard numbers from the firms at the table but that's also his best guess based on napkin math and conversations with TO. FWIW, I'd be surprised if the numbers were different by any significant magnitude, and would be surprised if any upfront money was included in any other offer.

Mr. Oringher is not an employee of Theodora Oringher. As Of Counsel to the Firm, he is an independent attorney with a separate law practice that handles matters and clients having no affiliation with the firm, who also works on certain specific matters for the firm on a contract and case by case basis. His work is not affiliated with TO unless the client has a current written engagement letter with our firm.",,No,Not Yet Sent,No,No,,,"Braun, Rachel;T.J. Henry",zcrm_1837424000045232384,"Notes from Rachel Braun:
We will really have to think about how to structure this, because unlike traditional firms that are buying that entire book of business and then paying a direct comp in return over a finite period, we are only “buying” 30% of books of business with the rest going to the attorneys. So perhaps if we do a more law firm traditional buyout here, we need to think about granting guaranteed comp for the top rainmakers instead of our normal ""eat what you kill"" approach.

They are talking to other more traditional firms.  ~40 FTE (no info on attorney vs staff breakdown), $25-30mm gross revenue, 50-65% of revenue generated by the only 2 equity partners: Todd Theodora and Kevin Dorse. 

Notable, per TJ: 2022 annualized run rate of $34-35mm, just under $800k revenue per attorney, and $9mm in open AR.

This call centered around the flexibility of what a potential offer would look like, which TO wanted to know before TO spent the time to engage. For example, in the other firms TO is talking to (bottom Amlaw 100 and also Amlaw 200), the firms are asking as a non-negotiable for all $9mm in open AR to be included in the transaction as a way to fund the transaction. While that's certainly a possibility for TO, our ability to be creative in structuring here in non-standard ways will be key, whether that's an upfront payment, leaving the AR out of the transaction, etc. I told Gary that we can certainly be creative in coming up with the best structure since everything is on the table for us. FWIW, most firms are likely to give them a 2-3 year guarantee on comp in exchange for the merger and the AR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.8374240000405862e+18,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zack is personable and I get the impression that he is very good at business development.  He has a transactional/regulatory background and after a few years in a small firm, he landed at Akerman where he developed a national cannabis practice.   He built this practice to over $1mm and then accepted an offer to go in-house to act as GC for one of the largest cannabis companies (Tru Leaf).  

Tru Leaf was a short-term job, and when it ended two years ago Zach returned to Akerman, where he again built his practice to over $1mm.  Sensing a downturn in the cannabis market, Zack began to approach banks and insurance companies that do work with cannabis operators, ensuring that his practice could continue to thrive.  He also approached one of Akerman's antitrust partners and developed an expertise in Hart Scott Rodino to supplement his practice (and to get much higher rates).  When that partner left the firm, Zack became the go-to attorney for HSR work at the firm.

Zack is very interested in business development and sets goals for himself in terms of becoming a thought leader.  He speaks at several conferences per year and is one of the most quoted Akerman lawyers in the press.

Rates $700 for Cannabis work.  $900+ for HSR work.  He does not need an office and says he is fairly self-sufficient, needing little associate or paralegal assistance on his matters.

Zack also has generated a lot of business for others at Akerman (which is part of his book).  Practice areas include corporate, tax, IP, litigation, real estate, securities and others.

Zack is considering leaving Akerman because they are not as interested in promoting his practice and also because he feels that while he has generated a lot of work for partners in other practice areas, there has been little to no reciprocation.

I think Zack would be an excellent addition to Rimon.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I really enjoyed speaking with Michael.  He was in public service from '06-18 representing pension funds in California (GC4, San Bernadino Cty) and managing the fund's assets.  He moved to Foley (they had been his outside counsel) as he had been targeted by partner Tom Hickey to take over his practice as he was retiring.

Michael has his own practice and at the beginning of '23 Tom retired and Michael assumed those clients as well (mostly pension funds and institutional investors).  Total book is $2.5M and fully portable (Foley has no other partner who can handle this work).  Additionally, 20-25% of Michael's practice is fielding fund and public sector questions from his partners (this is not portable, but he would be a great resource at Rimon).

Michael expressed a strong interest in representing his clients above all else.  He said comp is far less important to him (""I could happily go back to the public sector"").  He is exploring a move because his public sector clients cannot afford his ever-climbing rate ($850).

The biggest issue with a move to Rimon is whether we could provide him the leverage he needs to continue to represent his clients at the highest levels.  Currently, he uses about 5-6 associates, none full-time, making up about 2.5 FTEs.

If we can make sure Michael could continue to represent his clients at the highest level, I am 100% in favor of having him join us.",,,Public Pension Funds,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,"662 Valley View Drive, Redland, CA 92373",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chris is a personable employment litigation attorney who represents both public and private employers.  This year he has ""broken through,"" and went from $250k originations in 2022 to almost $1M by the close of 2023 (he has already collected $700k, has another $100k in ""young"" AR, and is sending out another $140k in bills by the end of the week).  His bill rate is $610 with room to increase it, although he does a minimal amount of insurance defense work (which he said he would handle himself).

Chris has made several moves but explained each to my satisfaction:  After clerking, he moved from NJ to LA and opened his own firm.  After a few years he merged his firm with a colleague but after a couple years with the merged entity the colleague developed ""personal issues"" requiring him to dissolve.  

Chris is an East Coast guy and convinced his wife to move back to NJ.  He went into the state's attorney's office as a ""springboard,"" and after a couple of years there joined Ballard.  Ballard was not a good fit because they began shedding employment lawyers and when a few of his colleagues joined Cozen, Chris followed.  He has been at Cozen for two years and is happy there but was intrigued by Rimon's model which is why he agreed to speak with us. 

Chris uses minimal secretarial and paralegal support but does uses about 1/2 of a FT associate (he said he could take on more of this work himself).   He also relies on partners outside of the NY/NJ area when employment litigation arises in other parts of the country.

I liked Chris and think he would be a good addition to Rimon.",,,,300,Rimon,,,,,,,Tara Humma (ref) who may join as associate,,,"38 Abey Drive, Pennington, NJ 08534",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a top-notch IP group.   Bob Whitman (electrical) and Mark Raskin (medical devices/life sciences) have built a team (one junior partner, two counsel and a senior paralegal) who have practiced together for several years across a couple of firms.

Their current firm is China-based, have recently closed their EU and Middle Eastern offices and is providing no support to the NY office.  The firm is also not transparent whatsoever. 

The group has at least a $5M fully portable book and they feel as though they have hit a ceiling. They want to build to at least $10M.  They bill their clients hourly, hourly with a success fee, contingent, and flat.  

Bob and Mark like that Rimon has an established IP group and is a full-service firm that is transparent and will allow them autonomy.

They do not need an office (shared meeting rooms are fine) and do not need much in support at present (although that could change as they continue to grow).  And their clients spin off work in other practice areas (corporate, tax, employment, other IP) and they would like to capture those dollars on Rimon's internal marketplace.

Mark and Bob want to move ASAP and are speaking with other firms.

Matt Grant is a litigator in St. Louis who has spent the majority of  his career at Husch Blackwell.  He recently left the firm of rate presssure and internal politics and is looking to immediately join a new firm (currently, he is working as counsel in an IP firm run by a friend who knows the situation is temporary).  Matt said he is speaking with a few AmLaw firms as well and wants to move by early March '24.

Matt's practice involves agricultural and crop seed litigation, along with some toxic tort work.  He has one main client (approximately $500k of his $750-900k book) - Bayer Montsanto, whose US headquarters is in St. Louis.  He is not servicing that client while he is in between firms but ""parked"" the client with an attorney he trusts.  Matt's main contact at Bayer Monsanto has assured him the work will go right back to him as soon as he joins a new firm.  However, the client will want to see Matt's proposed ""team,"" which, at least on paper, should include two associates and one paralegal.  Matt emphasized that this work ultimately could be done by others at Rimon and that the team he proposes will only be for the client to approve continuing to provide Matt with the work.

The client will like that Rimon has a St. Louis office but Matt likes to work remotely.  He does not usually use much paralegal time and uses minimal legal assistant support.

He has cross sold bankruptcy and commercial finance/loan work (which is specific to the AG industry).  The bankruptcy work will come to whatever firm he joins, he is less certain about the loan work.

Jerry Hathaway (who is the father of actress Anne Hathaway) is a 40+ year L&E practitioner who has been at Faegre Drinker for many years (he was on the Drinker side of the merger).  Most of his work is M&A L&E due diligence.  Interestingly, most of his work is referred to him by Paul Weiss when that firm is handling large M&A deals (he also gets work from Wachtel and Weil Gotchal).  He also has clients for whom he does L&E counseling and some litigation. 

Jerry is happy at his firm and would retire there but they have a mandatory retirement age of 70 and Jerry has no interest in taking a step back.  He is attracted to Rimon's model and of course the fact that we have no mandatory retirement age.  He is also considering FisherBroyles and three traditional firms.  One of his major PE clients has already greenlit his move to Fisher.

Jerry's book is usually between $1.2-2.4M, but trends towards $1.5M.  His rate is $1,205/hour.  

Jerry said he is mostly self-sufficient and could do all of his work himself.  However, he does have a counsel who works closely with him.

Chip represents clients in private equity transactions, acquisitions and divestitures of public and private companies, and offerings of debt and equity securities. Chip also represents private equity funds and their investors in connection with fund formation issues, securities law issues and portfolio company

addition, he has represented pension funds and other institutional investors in connection with their ongoing investment management activities.

Most of Chip's clients are in the energy sector, particularly renewable energy.  He knows Buz Barclay.

Chip practiced at Sullivan and Cromwell and then Troutman before leaving with a couple of other partners to form a boutique.  He decided to venture out on his own in April '23 but is finding the administrative part of running his own firm to be frustrating and he also believes his larger clients will give him larger matters if he has the backing of a larger, full-service firm. 

Chip does want to open a physical office in Atlanta, which we will have to discuss. He currently uses five contract associates for the thousands of hours he needs and would consider bringing some/all of them with him if he were to join Rimon.

Here are my notes from my ~45 min call with Christine and my review of her resume and law school transcript (resume re-attached for reference):

More mechanical notes, but someone perhaps worth having a follow-up meeting with Nicole or Geoff. She provided a plausible reason for reach move and represented to me that none of them were her being asked to leave. Moves were: wanted to move from NY to FL, wanted more sophisticated work, hated working with a particular partner, ended up working for just one client, and now because she doesn’t feel well integrated in her team as a remote worker.

She says that at DLA she largely runs most of the fundraising projects on which she works – initial setup and docs, LPA and side letter negotiations and revisions, running closings with junior associates and paralegals, etc. She’d like to be involved in group building, such as helping organize and put on trainings.

Says she’d prefer (at least initially) a salaried setup as opposed to an hourly one, in part because she’s looking to build a new house.

Law school:
-	Ranked #1 in her class
-	Federal income tax (A), state and local tax (A), corporate tax (A), international tax (A), taxation of M&A seminar (A), federal tax clinic (Pass)
Ropes in NYC:
-	17 months (plus summer associate)
-	Mainly mutual fund work
-	Left because wanted to move home to Florida and Ropes had no FL office and didn’t allow remote
Holland & Knight in FL:
-	11 months
-	Mainly mutual fund work
-	Left because they didn’t have much of a funds practice
Kirkland in TX:
-	30 months
-	Variety of funds, including lots of energy
-	Left because didn’t enjoy working with Matt Nadworny, P.C. | Professionals | Kirkland & Ellis LLP (although I couldn’t get any specific concerns or complaints from her)
Winston & Strawn in TX:
-	18 months
-	SBICs and other funds
-	Left because ended up working entirely for one client and wanted more variety (she says that DLA and Winston got into a bit of a bidding war for her as she announced she was leaving)
DLA Piper in FL remote:
-	18 months so far
-	Variety of funds, including lots of venture and real estate (but also crypto)
-	Doesn’t feel well integrated in the group as a remote person (says the group is a bunch of small groups clustered around certain partners, there aren’t group-wide trainings, no transparency into how work is assigned, etc)",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,"6706 71st E, Bradenton, FL 34203",,"W-2, firm sponsored",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dan Boyce is the quintessential trial lawyer.  He has been practicing for almost 40 years in the Raleigh area and has worked on some of the most major cases in North Carolina.  His father was a legendary trial lawyer as well.  He worked with his father, then was an AUSA, then went back to private practice ending up at his current firm.  The firm recently merged and he is not happy with management, which prompted him accepting a call from a recruiter.

Dan works with his 20-year paralegal Brenna, who would join as well.  They do not need an office.  Associate help would be nice, and he said he could keep 1/2 of an associate busy, but not a definite necessity at this time.  Dan does generate work outside of litigation due to his deep roots in the Raleigh area, including tax, employment, corporate, IP, etc.  Rates are $550-575.

Dan did not quantify his book and, unlike his recruiter, said it is NOT $1M.  He said he does not want to work 1500-1900 hours/year anymore.   He will put together numbers to determine his anticipated portable book and will revert.

I liked Dan a lot but whether he is a good fit for Rimon is an open question, depending on his book.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,"Would bring longtime paralegal ""Brenna""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jon is a superstar.  He is 41 and graduated law school in 2011 (joint MBA/JD Northwestern).  He started his career at Sullivan & Cromwell in their M&A group.  After a couple of years, he realized he most enjoyed VC/emerging company work and moved to Goodwin in CA.  Over time, he realized that he enjoyed both practicing law and the business side as well.

He left Goodwin and started his own firm and also a venture fund, teaming up with another individual and raised $75mm, and worked mostly with Israeli start-ups.  He partnered with the Silverstein family that owns NY's World Trade Center and had a floor in that building.

In 2019, he had two associates and an admin and his legal book was around $750k.

One of his clients was in the cannabis space,  and he eventually joined that company, becoming CEO and Chairman of the Board.  The firm merged and now has a several hundred million dollar valuation.  As he throttled back on legal work he merged with another small firm run by a friend.

Jon now wants to plunge back fulltime into practicing law but he does not enjoy running a firm.  His book is around $500k, but this is clearly a brilliant, hardworking guy who is the epitome of entrepreneurial.  I highly recommend continuing the process with Jon.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mario is a Florida barred tax attorney.  He has $400k in originated business that consists of wealthy individuals and families and international businesses.  60% of his work is international corporate and 40% is estate planning (he does some work on CIFIUS matters as well). 

Mario has a tax background (he started at Deloitte) and has been in DC for 16 years because his wife wants to be here and not in Florida. Most of his work is Florida and South American based.  He knows and works with Rodrigo Cottin.

Mario was not necessarily looking to switch firms but his firm ""is at an inflection point.""  Whiteford has about the same number of lawyers as Rimon and they are aging out and the senior partners are not productive.  This has to change but no one in management is doing anything about it.

I have a couple of concerns about this one. First, Mario's book is under our minimum threshold.  This would be fine for a servicing tax partner, but we would need that only if Roy Gillig were fully engaged (I understand he is not at present).

Second, Mario volunteered that his current comp is $330,000, which is over 80% of his $400,000 book (as of today he has a $300,000 handle and $290,000 in the door - he is working on end-of-year collections).

Mario's ""mentor"" at Whiteford named Liz Atkinson is a tax controversy partner who also may be interested in Rimon. Mario said Liz' book is approximately $500,00.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arthur brings expertise in municipal, state, and federal policy and regulatory issues, particularly focused on national and state broadband funding initiatives.  He works with a Senior Policy Advisor who would come with him.   they also may bring an assistant who is just out of college.  They are otherwise fairly self-sufficient.  Arthur said that the work is more policy oriented than legal.

Arthur told me that they are happy at their current firm, which is one of the best telecom firms in the country (and they have a $2M book (he guessed about $1.5 was portable)).  However, they are repeatedly running into conflicts and they want to see if there is another firm that would alleviate that problem.  This is particularly necessary now, as in 2024 the government is going to distribute $42B for broadband and Arthur wants to be able to pitch to small to midsized clients that he can help them receive some of those funds.  He will have a problem doing so because of conflicts with larger utility-sized firm clients.  

Arthur also mentioned more than once that perhaps existing Rimon clients could benefit from Arthur's team helping them potentially receive some of the funds mentioned above.

Arthur did say he would be nervous about coming to a firm with no salary/draw and that he would have to speak with his colleague about whether to continue the process.

I think this could be an intriguing match for Rimon.

Mark, who is friends with John Mussman, is a very affable guy and a pleasure to speak with. He is a rainmaker who has done a mix of corporate and litigation over the years but now does strictly corporate work.  He calls himself a ""trusted advisor"" and gets referrals for work internationally (US, Zurich, London, Malaysia etc.) in numerous practice areas (corporate, L&E, IP, litigation, real estate).  His clients include banks, corporations, family offices, NBA and NFL players and more.  In the last 18 months, Mark has worked with 67 partners, associates and paralegals. 

This year, Mark's collections will be around $2.1M and he is grossly undercompensated (seriously).

One concern that I explored is that Mark has moved several times in recent years.  He had his own firm for years but sold it in 2012 to a Chicago firm and was on a one-year contract.  One of his main clients at that time was BofA, who had most of its work done by Duane Morris.  His contact at BofA convinced Mark to move there.  Mark thought DM was a great firm, but they raised his rates, eventually to $900/hour and a majority of his clients balked.  So, after four years at DM, Mark went with five of his colleagues to Thompson Coburn, which, in Mark's words, was ""a total train wreck.""  Mark and his colleagues were never fully integrated into the firm and were actively excluded by the existing Chicago partners.

So, 18 months after joining TC, Mark went to Johnson & Bell for three years.  He ran that firm's corporate practice and doubled his book.  The rates were reasonable.  Mark was not looking to leave but he know a lot of lawyers at his now-current firm (Hinshaw) and they convinced him to move there.  At Hinshaw, Mark doubled his book again. The problem is that he is not getting compensated in any way close to what he should be given his originations/collections.  Thus, Mark is considering another move, this time to Rimon (John Mussman has occasionally suggested that Mark join us).

Mark utilizes 1/2 of a FT Corp. associate and 1/2 time of a litigation associate but would of course consider working with partners or paralegals.

Rates: $525-$825
**corporate - $500-$600
**regulatory - $800

I like Mark a lot.  He has made several recent moves but his explanation for them track with me.  I recommend we continue the process.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Geoff is a very impressive younger litigation partner.  He began his career at Reed Smith (he knows Paul Gupta and Joe Rosenbaum) and moved to Katten a few years ago.

He is also experiencing significant rate pressure as his current rack rate is $1,200/hour.  

Geoff sources work from a strong network of former law school classmates who have moved inhouse and give him litigation matters.   A significant portion of his matters are in the life sciences area, but he also handles matters in the financial services and media/entertainment sectors (clients include PwC, Saks, Epic Games, Hearst Media).

Cristina Cardenas was a Reed Smith partner and was introduced to us at the end of July ‘23 with Eduardo De la Pena. They have worked together for 15 years.  At that time their combined book was around $1.5mm.  Rate pressure and conflicts were hurting their practice at Reed Smith, plus the senior partner with whom they worked was retiring at the end of ’23.   I very much enjoyed meeting with them and hoped we could land them both.

As the months went by, they became unresponsive.  Of course, Eduardo resurfaced and is now slated to join us at the beginning of April (with a projected book around $650-700k).  During the past six months, Cristina’s situation changed.  Her father became ill and she had to take a big step back from her practice to help with the family horse business.  Also, Cristina was repeatedly running into roadblocks to being named arbitrator on matters (actual conflicts, business conflicts and needing the Chairman’s approval to be named an arbitrator).  Reed Smith asked her to leave the firm at the end of the year.

Since that time, Cristina has completed what she needed to do for her family’s business and has been rebuilding her practice on her own.  She submitted an LPQ which reflects that her book is not yet close to our $650k minimal requirement.  But Cristina has a strong conviction that she will be able to rebuild in short order and would love to continue to work with Eduardo here at Rimon.  Adding Ricardo Ampudia is a great help too.

Bottom line, I think we should proceed with Cristina despite her numbers not being where we usually would want them.",,,International Arbitration: 60% International Litigation: 40%,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,3401 West Hwy 318 Citra FL 32113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pair have around $900k in portable business, which is beneath the typical Rimon book threshold.  But they are referring out hundreds of thousands of dollars in work outside of their practice area, which is one of the biggest reasons they want to move to a larger platform (the others are (a) they do not enjoy the administrative burden of running their own firm; and (b) they want to attract larger clients who can pay higher rates).

The firm has a six-month ""lease"" of co-work office space which comes with administrative support.  We discussed them finding other office space if they were to join Rimon.

Rates are $400 for most clients, $450 for larger clients.  

They employ a full time paralegal that they would like to bring, an administrative assistant they may bring, and a part time law clerk (15 hours/week) they also might want to bring.

Anne and Tina could be fine additions.

Jamaica is a very outgoing IP litigation/prosecution partner.  She was referred to us by incoming partner Chris Loveland, who has worked closely with Jamaica's husband for many years.  

Her book last year was $650-700k, but this year she has added a gene editing client with 150 patents (her clients have 400 total) and she fully anticipates doing $1-1.2mm in 2024.   Her current rack rate is $900, discounted rate is $730.  Rate pressure is an issue, as is her firm's lack of commitment to the IP practice.

 Jamaica seems to be an excellent business generator for both herself and others in the firm.  Cross selling matters include corporate, employment, construction, bankruptcy, real estate and privacy.

W/r/t equity in clients, and for mainly conflicts reasons, the firm slightly altered its policy on taking equity in clients in late Q3 last year. In short, the firm does not want to take equity in clients moving forward, but if a partner wants to do so, the firm has no issue with it. As a result, we're left with two effective options: 1) 70% of the legal fees can be paid in equity (to the attorney, personally) with 30% being paid in cash (to the firm), or 2) 100% of the legal fees can be paid in equity (to the attorney personally), but the firm would request that the equivalent 30% in cash be deducted from the attorney's ARA. 

Option 1 is certainly cleaner, but perhaps not always preferable from a client perspective. Option 2 results in the attorney and the firm aligning on a mechanism and timing to accomplish that (for example, taking into account how long the representation is expected to last, making sure that external billing rate and hours are tracked, etc). We're typically open to number of months post termination of the representation to effectuate this (typically 3 months or so), or to align as we go along during the representation.",,,"His clients are a mix of major U.S. and international producers (Latin America, Asia), midstream companies, independent commodity trading houses/markets, start-ups and private equity.

Deborah is a very outgoing partner candidate who has run her own firm and focuses on originating business.  She is a litigator who also dabbles in corporate and real estate transactional matters.  Examples of her litigation matters include a crypto case where she anticipates receiving a $200-300k retainer and a US collections matter for a French corporate client.

Her year-to-year book is $1-2mm (this year trending towards $2mm).  

Deborah ran her own firm for 11 years but hit a growth ceiling and decided to join a Houston boutique.  She was there for three years and left one year ago to go to another firm who wooed her saying they wanted her to grow commercial litigation and corporate work.  But after one year, Deborah has realized that the firm is too set in their ways and backwards thinking.  She is looking to move to a more cutting-edge firm, and she was very enthusiastic about Rimon's model. 

Deborah would want office space in Houston and I explained that cost would likely be born (mostly or entirely) by her.  She suggested sharing office space with another firm.  She has one 8th year associate (Nick) that she would want to sponsor, and she has two paralegals that are at her previous firm that she would want to try to get to come with her to Rimon.

I liked speaking with Deborah tremendously and she seems like a strong rainmaker.  My only concern is that while litigation is her primary practice area she doesn't have a niche (as she handles corporate, real estate and some tax matters as well).  However, much of this might be cross-selling.  

I recommend continuing the process with Deborah.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,Louise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 2011, Alan has moved around a lot.  He has been at five firms since the firm he was at for 10 years imploded.  From there, he moved to  Schiff Hardin but that firm soon forced him give up his largest client and he left after 1.5 years.  He then went to a regional NY firm and realized the fit was not appropriate and left after 1.5 years.

Alan then opened his own firm in 2014.  But in 2017 he got divorced and needed more stability, so he joined ""CKR.""  That firm disbanded in 2019, which is why he moved to his current firm.

Alan wants to leave his current firm because he believes he receives no benefit from it.  He thinks Rimon would be the perfect fit.  All of his clients are portable.

In '22 Alan chose to go to Offit Kurman instead of Rimon.  If he joins Rimon now that will be seven firms since 2011.

Her clients are primarily land use developers in Southwest Washington and Oregon where she services them in negotiating permits, ‎land use applications, development agreements, inter-‎governmental and P3 agreements as well as litigation, land use disputes, administrative hearings and appeals.  

Maren started out as a commercial litigator in California and then Hawaii (admitted, but inactive).  During that time, she was often pulled into large bankruptcy cases to work on their real estate disputes and condominium law. In 2011, she was called back to active duty and worked on legislative affairs and administrative law issues at the Pentagon and Capitol Hill. Maren retired from the Air Force in 2016 and returned to private practice in the Pacific Northwest focusing on land use law and related administrative procedures.

Maren and her partner Steve Horenstein transitioned to Schwabe together from his firm, Horenstein Law Group in Vancouver, and would like to make the next move together with their associate (Josaundra), who is a second-year associate with 20+ years' experience as a paralegal. Steve is more senior and will likely practice another five to seven years and transition his clients to Maren. Steve's practice focuses on business planning, transactions, and finance; commercial real estate transactions, leasing, and finance; land use and environmental permitting; and government relations, advocacy, and public policy.  Maren and Steve have over a $2mm book together.  

When the group came to Schwabe certain promises were made that have not materialized, and they don't believe the firm has the same vision as when they joined. They are looking for a firm that if willing to look at the practice of law creatively and that values collegiality and collaboration. Maren is also passionate about mentoring younger attorneys.

Jarett is only eight years out of law school and has built a book of business already.  He is a diverse candidate who primarily does commercial litigation with a focus on construction (which is 1/2 of his book).  He also brings in work through client contacts from when he was in the NFL (he is a former wide receiver who played with the Jaguars and Lions among others).  The cross-selling involves sports/entertainment work including sponsorship agreements and also involves corporate, finance and some M&A.  This work could be as much as $350,000.

Jarett was at Kilpatrick and then Reed Smith but he left Reed Smith at the end of February because (a) the partner that he was working with left the firm leaving Jarett on an island; and (b) his mandated rate of $900+ is too high for his clients.  Jarett had the financial means to leave his firm to systematically search for the right fit.

Jarett was very impressed with the Rimon model and is confident that he can generate $600-800k in his first year between doing his own work and cross selling.  He does most of his own work himself (he would want legal assistants to help him make court filings) and while he would like an office eventually, he doesn't need one and in any event wouldn't want to go to an office that is not populated.

I think Jarett can be a great addition to Rimon.  My only concern is that he is a younger partner candidate and thus does not have a track record of business generation.  I think we should continue the process with an eye towards assessing his book.",,,Construction Litigation,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,J.P.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Robert is an energetic and business-oriented tax attorney.  His business is 1/2 transactional and 1/2 controversy (specializing in cross-border tax matters) and he has built a $600k book in a relatively short time.  As part of his practice, he provides tax advice regarding entity structuring, mergers and acquisitions, and financing transactions. Robert also has extensive experience in tax examinations, appeals, and litigation.

Before joining his current firm, Robert practiced with the IRS, the U.S. Department of Treasury, and advised the Joint Committee on Taxation. After serving in the government, Robert moved to private practice in D.C., focusing on tax controversy and planning and teaching International Tax Controversy at Georgetown.

He is considering a move because his current firm has lost several partners (including in the tax group) and is unnecessarily bureaucratic. 

Robert is very interested in the Rimon model, which he thought might be a far more preferable place to practice than his current firm, without the headaches of opening his own shop.  He does not need an office and does not need much associate or paralegal support.  

Cross selling includes T&E, corporate, IP and litigation.  

I liked Robert a lot and think he would be a great addition to Rimon.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nicolas is a M&A partner who specializes in mid-market deals ($100-300mm).  Deals span several industries (health/life sciences, manufacturing, energy, tech).  He has spent much of his career in Paris but has moved to Dallas with his family.  He is licensed in France and in NY and is waiving into the Texas bar.  

Nicolas has been at McDermott for the past 13 years (before McDermott, Nicolas was at Cravath in NY and the Herbert Smith in the UK) and he knows Takashi Saito and Tomoki Tanida.  He is successful at McDermott but is facing rate pressure from French clients that require both French and US legal advice.  He also believes that McDermott is focusing more and PE work and his M&A practice is not the best fit any longer.

In addition to French clients, Nicolas has a LatAm cross-border practice that he wants to continue to grow and which would be a great fit at Rimon.

Nicolas said he does not need an office (he is willing to try it and see how it goes), and while he does use associate time, he likes to do most of the work himself (he uses junior associates mostly on larger M&A transactions.  For example, last year he had a $1B M&A transaction that required associate help).

Cross selling includes, employee benefits, tax, CIFIUS and others.

Josh Sutton is a Counsel at Sidley Austin in the Houston office that he was instrumental in setting up in 2012. Josh’s practice focuses on joint ventures, private equity investments (developer side), and other commercial transactions relating to the development, construction, financing, acquisition, sale and investment in energy and infrastructure related projects and businesses. About 70% of Josh's work is project development and 30% is M&A and includes private equity clients, energy clients, solar developers.

Josh left Sidley to take an in-house position overseas in Saudi Arabia for seven years. Sidley contacted him with a great offer which brought him back to the States. 

As counsel at Sidley, Josh is required to transfer the origination credit for his clients to a partner, which has left him feeling unfairly compensated on his $1mm book. In addition, there has been shift in management and the firm is no longer interested in supporting the growth of the Energy practice. Rate pressure is also an issue for Josh as his billing rate is already $1430/hr. Josh has deep contacts in the Middle East and has not been able to bring in that work at Sidley without an international presence.

If the firm is interested in putting effort into growing an Energy practice, Josh would be a great addition.

John is a cross-border corporate partner at Womble who lives in Nashville but splits his time between there and DC.  He has a robust China practice, and his clients generate business in many practice areas, including IP, economic development, CIFIUS, public company work, labor & employment.  One of his Chinese clients just handed off its entire patent portfolio, which John believes will generate $300k+ this year (in addition to his current book).

He also has clients who need cross-border transaction assistance in Europe and Central and South America.  Further John serves as Honorary Consul from Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Tennessee and receives work from this as well.

Book is consistently over $1.3mm and his rates are typically $750/hour (although some clients are billed in the $600s).  He also charges a lot of flat fees.

John is weary of Womble and BigLaw in general.  Womble has no real international presence, and his partners get a lot of referrals flowing to them from John, but there is very little in the way of referrals flowing back to John.

If he were to join Rimon, John discussed bringing his associate (whom I believe will need a visa sponsorship), who resides in Houston.  He also may wish to bring a counsel level attorney with whom he works at Womble, who resides in DC.

John also provides non-legal consulting services to his clients and wanted to make sure that was ok with Rimon (I understand it is).

Lauren estimates that she would only bring 4 associates (1 private equity, 2 real estate and 1 general) to support her practice. Their work is divided by skillset.  Lauren's goal is to be able to have to take the administrative burdens off her plate.

Lauren has 3 large clients - one that makes up about 40% of their practice, another that produces 20% and one that produced 20%. They handle about 150 NDAs per year. She uses mostly flat fees and current rates are $2500 per vendor contract, $800-$1800 for NDAs and hourly rates of $600/hr.

Prior to joining Day Pitney, Alex served as the legislative attorney to the Energy and Technology Committee of the Connecticut General Assembly.

Alex primarily works with energy clients on regulatory, compliance and transactional matters. About 75% of his practice is focused on working with competitive suppliers (electricity and gas) across the country on permitting, state regulatory diligence and compliance issues. He routinely does work in 10-12 states. The remaining portion of his practice is focused on project development and financing, due diligence and other deal work for renewable energy acquisition assets and fuel cell assets in the Connecticut, New England and mid-Atlantic area. Alex has a few institutional clients, but the bulk of his book consists of long-time clients he has originated.

Alex is very focused on business development and is excited for the cross-selling and cross-marketing opportunities Rimon would offer.  The practice areas that would be most helpful in supporting his practice would be real estate, environmental, data privacy, securities and litigation. Access to attorneys admitted in both state and federal court in the New England and mid-Atlantic states would be useful. He would also benefit from someone with FERC knowledge. He has ongoing litigation matters in Connecticut and potential litigation in Maryland.

Alex has a 6th year associate who is his right hand.  She is currently 100% remote and based in San Diego.  If he is unable to bring her aboard, it is a nonstarter. 

Alex is very intrigued by the model.

Tara is an employment litigation counsel at Ballard.  As a younger associate, she used to work with incoming partner Chris Kelly and served as one of his references.  Chris discussed Rimon with her and she is interested in joining as well and teaming up with Chris.  

Chris told me he has 700-900 hours of work that he can give to Tara.  She also has what she believes willl be up to $500,000 in business of her own.  Tara also would be willing to work with other Rimon L&E partners.

The team is considering opening their own boutique.  Akin's rates are too high and there is too much overhead.  They reached out because they would rather join an international firm and not have to manage a firm.  They like Rimon's global reach (they have business in the US, Australia, LatinAm and Europe.  They also want to be able to work remotely (Tom spends significant time in the US (lake house in Michigan).

Mike and Tom want to spend a couple of weeks considering what type of team they will bring and whether it will be only their historical practice (which may involved two non-Akin partners, one who is in Sydney and another UK but US qualified lawyer) another UK finance lawyer that is US qualified (they are thinking of one of amongst 2-3 they could bring) and a mid-to-senior level associate.

If they also wanted to build a leveraged finance practice that would entail many others.  They have two Akin partners on their team that are in the US who cover the Americas.

Jeff is a very friendly and loquacious transactional real estate partner candidate.  He has a BigLaw background but started his own firm 27 years ago.  He works closely with current candidate Christine Gregorak. 

Jeff has numerous large clients including Maxsar, Stanford Hotels, NTT Data (one of the largest companies in Japan who is spending billions to open data centers in the US), among others.  His book is consistently $1.5-2M (he has already collected $430,000 through March).  He bills 1400-1800 hours/year.  Rate is now $775, prior rate was $705.

Jeff would continue his practice as-is but his other partner is no longer practicing at a level that makes sense for them to continue their partnership.  He will dissolve his current firm by the end of April 2024.  

Jeff is considering a 3-5 year plan where eventually he would transition his book to Christine Gregorak (her hourly rate is currently $650).

He does have an office but said he is the only one that goes there so he is happy to forego the space if he can spend 1 day/week in Rimon's SF office.  He has a longtime paralegal (Patsy West) who he would likely bring with him.  He also has a part-time attorney who he may continue to use as an outside contractor and another para/admin whom he is unsure as to whether not he would bring.

Jeff is considering going out on his own.  He is also speaking with Nixon Peabody and Hansen Bridgett.

He has a BigLaw background, having previously worked at Akerman and Ford Harrison before joining his current firm, which he did when they asked him to be the employment law practice group leader and grow that practice.

Vince has decided to leave his current firm due to attrition and the fact that one of his main clients recently (March 1, 2024) asked him to take on work that will likely double his current book (to over $1.5mm).  He is considering opening his own firm but does not relish the idea of running the firm and all of the attendant headaches that go along with that.  He thinks Rimon could be the perfect sweet spot between BigLaw and a solo practice. 

Vince also cross sells trademark litigation, dram shop litigation and some M&A work.  Cross sold dollars are in addition to his stated book (he did not quantify). 

Vince does not need an office (although he has five school-aged children).  He does most of his work himself but realizes that with the additional work he has recently been given he will need some associate/paralegal help.  His rack rate is $650/hour (of his 27 open matters, three are covered by insurance with a lower mandated rate).

I liked Vince and think he could be a strong addition to Rimon.  He would fit in nicely with our other NJ employment litigation partner Chris Kelly (and Tara Humma when she joins).",,,defends employers across all industry sectors,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,"5 Partridge Run, West Windsor, NJ 08550",,,Mantella,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dallas Office:
My current firm’s Dallas office is small, though we do have several talented lawyers there.  The firm has three full-time lawyers in that office, another who is moving to Tulsa and one other lawyer who is essentially part-time in hours worked.  Although my firm does want to grow the office there (main priority for growth are the office HQ in Tulsa and OKC), it is extremely hesitant to take the risk of lateral expansion, which to me is frustrating, because I expressed a desire to be down there, especially when I first came back on board at C&W in April 2017.  Before coming on board in 2017, I was told Dallas would be an option if I would agree to a formula and essentially an eat-what-you-kill arrangement.  I couldn’t do so at the time, coming from the firm I had been at which was cash-poor - I needed a stable (and better) salary at the time.  If I broached the subject again today (which I haven’t brought it back up), I’m not sure what the answer would be - although I know the preference would be to have me in the Tulsa (HQ) office.

It was expressed to me by the firm’s President (a good friend of mine) that the focus of the firm is to shore-up its main offices:  Tulsa and Oklahoma City.  It is essentially an Oklahoma-based firm; though I believe the better business is located in Texas.  And I can fully practice law and represent my Oklahoma-based clients wherever my office is, including in Dallas.",,No,,No,No,Commercial Litigation;Insurance;Intellectual Property Litigation,Chose to stay at current firm,,zcrm_1837424000057680609,"$385/hour is his typical hourly bill rate.

He has a very strong business plan and believes he will be able to generate $250k+ from his current employer (real estate lit. and capital markets) and several hundred thousand dollars more from his prospective client contacts and SDNY network. 

I think Andrew could build a successful practice at Rimon. Of course, coming from in-house he would need to ramp up quickly.  It all depends on his current employer giving him work.

Last year, the firm had $9.2M in revenues and $7m in expenses (but this includes salaries). 

The nonequity attorneys are paid a salary with incentives although Jeana said some apparently are not incentivized enough as they are not working enough. 
 
Jean has found scaling from where she currently is to be a challenge which is why she is speaking with Rimon. 

 I do not believe this would be a good addition for Rimon because the quality of lawyers are not at Rimon's level.  Additionally, Jeana was a little off-putting.  She said she does not consider her partners and other employees to be like family, she considers it a moneymaking business venture and seemingly would not hesitate to cut people.

Spoke with Keith Sutton (MP) and James Courtney (founding partner).  Their lease is up in February, and they are doing an analysis of where they are as a firm and where they want to go. 

The firm is transactional (real estate and corporate/finance) and the lawyers all come from BigLaw.  The synergies are there and Keith mentioned that they firm's revenue is $40mm.  

The firm is 5 equity partners and 9-10 additional attorneys and staff.  Lease will not be renewed because the rates are exorbitant.  

This was an exploratory call.  Keith said he was interested because a Rimon-esque firm ""is what we should've done."" He was very interested in what the 30% covers.

Keith is unsure if only him, some of combination of attorneys, or the whole firm would join Rimon if that were to happen.  He needs to sit down with the other equity partners and have a full discussion.

Dan's firm is a regional Portland, Or. firm that broke off from a larger Portland firm.  In December '22, Dan was recruited there from the government to do environmental work.

The firm has some similarities to Rimon.  It is eat what you kill and partners pay a fee for back office support.  Working partners pay a 15% referral fee to originators.

Dan lives in the DC area but travels to Portland 1x/month.  He is traveling  there next week and there will be a quarterly partner meeting on Thursday, June 8.  He promised to mention Rimon to his partners.

Noah started his career in the Justice Department and was there for seven years.  In 2016 he moved to Baker Botts for two years and then became an AUSA in the Western District of Texas.  He would have stayed there but in 2020 Justice wanted him to move to DC for a year and he was about to have his fifth child.  He moved to DLA as a Counsel so he could stay in Dallas.

DLA promised that Noah would have plenty of work but when he arrived there was almost none.  So, he marketed himself extensively within the firm and over time became the go-to litigator for the firm's Investment Management Group.  Noah is now a co-leader for the firm's Private Fund Disputes practice, and he focuses on institutional investors, with an emphasis on public investment systems, sovereign wealth funds, and development finance institutions, as well as financial services companies of all types.

Noah's efforts have allowed him to quickly grow his book of business with very little help from his firm.  The firm does not help him market his practice (which he says he definitely wants at his new firm) and he is dramatically undercompensated considering he has managed to build a $2-3mm book over the last couple of years.  Most of this work will be portable. 

Rates are currently $1,100.  He does not need an office, uses about 700-1000 hours of associate time and sporadically needs paralegal help.

I found Noah to be a bit intense and very confident in his abilities.  If our IM group could utilize his expertise, Noah could be a strong asset.  I recommend we pursue his candidacy.",,,"Private funds disputes, retirement systems, distressed investments",,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Private Management Notes 3
I just had breakfast with Norma Garcia and their group is very much in play.  Their main hesitations are (i) losing their autonomy and sense of family (the 5 partners as a team) and (ii) their current overhead is around 15% so they’d be giving up double.  Notwithstanding, she is VERY intrigued and this may be the right moment to make a change this year.

As to (i) autonomy: I am going to introduce her to Jenn Duffy to discuss how the Santa Barbara team came over and that they have integrated very well while still keeping their sense of “local family”.  I think we can win them over on this score.

(ii) Overhead and profitability:  I told her that the key to overcome this fear is that she can make up the lost revenue on the internal market.  Moreover, Norma is very frustrated because she as lost some very high ticket litigation matters recently to larger firms.  She is concerned that the small profile of her current firm is going to keep her forever handling small potatoes matters for certain clients and she knows she is losing opportunity under the current circumstances.  We can solve this for her and she knows it.  In addition, our depth in real estate and cross-border planning could help her capture more work that they can’t currently handle.

She needs to convince her partners that the benefits of a Rimon move would outweigh what they perceive as leaving money on the table.  I could see the gears turning in her head.  We may need to proceed with an interim Global Alliance arrangement for them to get more comfortable but we can definitely close this one but it will take some continued nurturing on our part.  However, I could see bringing this on board and increasing their origination significantly under our platform.",,No,Not Yet Sent,No,No,Corporate;Employment Law;Intellectual Property;Litigation;Real Estate,Chose to stay at current firm,"Ford, Jayne;Medrano, Manny;Wisneski, Ed;Zuniga, Juan",zcrm_1837424000006427129,"Note from Juan 8/12/22:

In that scenario, all revenue (after the Rimon 30%) comes into their company, they pay their wages and maintain their existing retirement plans?  Or are we not allowing such a model any more?

Anthony is a self-described ""fast talking Italian Brooklyn litigator.""  He is very friendly.  He had a career in financial services/broker dealer before going to law school and he is now getting his PhD. in finance.  He is licensed in five states, but most of his matters are in NY and FL.

His practice consists mostly of securities defense/FINRA arbitrations, broker/dealer matters.  He said he knows the field inside and out and has never lost a FINRA matter.

Anthony started his career at a boutique firm and was there for nine years. About 18 months ago he joined a larger Long Island firm, and they made certain promises to him, including opening an office in Manhattan that he could use a few times/week (he said Rimon's pending office should work fine).  He also is not receiving as much comp as he feels he deserves.  

Book is always more than $1mm and at times has reached $2mm.  He is on pace for $1.6mm this year.  He also cross-sells in numerous practice areas (an additional $300-400k).  Rate is typically $665.  Anthony said he needs about 100 hours/month of associate time.  We discussed how associates are sponsored at Rimon and he would not be opposed to sponsoring an associate but not until he became settled at the firm.

Anthony immediately understood Rimon's model and was very interested.  He is considering whether to open his own firm or to join a firm like Rimon, and he wants to make that decision in over the next 30 days.

At Berkley, Adam  oversees a set of breach-of-contract and constitutional cases against the United States government over losses to the companies’ Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stockholdings through the government’s post-financial crisis regulatory actions.  He is prosecuting an insurance fraud action against a bank, law firm, and alleged co-conspirators arising from a highly-visible criminal investigation into legal corruption. He is also managing a portfolio of recapture cases arising from the firm’s employee stock-grant program, seeking to shape the development of Delaware law on the employee-choice doctrine. 

Adam misses the variety and complexity of work available in a law firm environment and is looking for an opportunity where he can return to a firm and practice both commercial litigation and employment litigation. He is looking at both traditional and alternative firms and plans to bring Berkley over as a client wherever he lands.

Adam is very likeable, and his practice would fit in well. He seems to be entrepreneurial and well connected to develop business.  It will be imperative to review Adam's business plan to make sure the economics work.",,,In-house Litigator,,Rimon,,,,,,,None.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stefan is a chemical patent prosecution partner and co-chair of the firm’s MENA (Middle East North Africa) area practice group.  He counsels domestic and foreign clients, most of his clients are Saudi entities. He has successfully prosecuted patents and defended industry-leading methods for recovering petroleum resources, petroleum exploration and development, and chemical process development, design and manufacturing. Additionally, he advises his clients on inventorship, chemical and business methods, patentability, validity and enforceability and represents them before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) and in disputes in district court litigation. He is also actively involved in establishing intellectual property programs and patent portfolios for clients based in the Middle East.

Stefan is looking outside of his current firm for the first time in 23 years because the firm is ""unhealthy,"" and he is undercompensated while several senior partners are paid more and working far less.  

Current book is $4M.  Most is flat fee billing.  He mentioned that his clients often pay in a ""lumpy"" fashion, sometimes not paying in full for several months (mostly because the Saudi government has to approve payments outside of SA).  He is not concerned about this even on Rimon's model, although he would have to pay his staff in a timely fashion.

Stefan services about 10% of this work himself.  The bulk of the work is performed by his team of six patent agents ($150k/year each) and three paralegals.  He is unsure how many of his staff would follow if he were to join Rimon, but said it would be at least 50%.

Patrick is a top international arbitration partner candidate who had been based in China but has moved to the LA area, both for family and client reasons (China's economy is down and Chinese entities are looking to invest outside of China, including in the US).  His book is between $3-4mm, and he represents a number of Chinese entities in front of arbitration bodies in numerous locations.  He also represents non-Chinese corporations and foreign governments.  He has a strong grasp of Chinese and UK law. 

Patrick is licensed in NY and attended Berkeley for his LLM, where he met Zheng several years ago (Zheng did not recall the meeting but that is likely because she was setting up a program for students and Patrick was one of many students).  He is sitting for the CA bar soon.  He also has a green card.

Zheng took the lead in discussing Rimon's China practice with Patrick and explained that our Shenzen office is not a law office (it is a consulting office) and that we likely would not be opening an office there.  Patrick utilizes up to four associates there at present and he indicated he would like to have one or two of them join him if he were to join Rimon.  This obviously could not work if Rimon is not willing to open an office there.

Another issue is that Patrick represents SOEs (state owned entities) and we are not inclined to do so (this could cause problems with existing Taiwanese clients for instance and also open us up to scrutiny from governmental agencies).

Patrick could be a strong addition to Rimon if he were willing to forego representing SOEs and could find US associates who can handle Chinese and other international arbitration matters, this could work.  If not, there would be too many obstacles.",,,Dispute Resolution,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I spoke with Paul Jones, who is the main partner at Jones Pyatt.

April is remote and works with one paralegal.

Paul wants to expand his practice to $5m over the next few years and is finding it difficult running a small firm.  He is also tired of running his own practice, which he says cuts into his ability to gain additional clients.

Chris is a very friendly and outgoing commercial litigator (he also handles bankruptcy matters).  He lives in Ft. Lauderdale, and he splits his practice between Florida and Ohio/Kentucky where he lived previously.

He was first a Rimon candidate in May '20 when he was a partner in a small firm in Cincinnati.  Since that time, Chris has made several moves, all of which made sense to me as he described them. First, moved to Ft. Lauderdale and chose Dickinson Wright over Rimon, thinking he wanted to remain in a traditional firm.  But he did not like the size of the firm, preferring a smaller shop, so in May '22 he moved to Gray Robinson.  He liked that firm but was approached by Taylor English in April '23, where he had many connections.  By then, Chris, who had already explored a distributed model, was ready to try it.  He has been happy at TE, but he told me there are changes occurring at with the firm comp. structure which will negatively affect him.  Further, he cannot get the help he needs to maintain his practice - he is turning away work and working far too many hours (2500+) which is negatively affecting him personally.  Thus, he approached us to restart his candidacy.

In the past few years, Chris has built his practice to where he is on pace for over $800k this year.  He told me he does not need office space (although ""it would be nice""), but he would want Rimon to consider opening a virtual office in Cincinnati and/or Lexington KY so he would have website visibility with his clients that are based in that region.  

Chris does need associate help on the ground in Florida so that he can reduce his hours and focus on additional BD and his personal life.  I told him that he would need to sponsor a Florida associate, which he understood.  He also contemplated hiring a legal assistant.

I liked Chris personally very much, which is consistent with the interviews he had with other Rimon partners in '20.  I recommend we continue the process with him.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,Donald,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was polished, interesting and clearly very good at what he does.  He is based in Rome and his ""partner"" Martin Guizzardi is based in Milan.   Nicola did spend 32 years in the US before moving back to Italy.

Nicola has been a partner with Bryan Cave for 15 years and has been affiliated with the firm’s Chicago office that entire time. He moved to Rome about 18 months ago and is working remotely from there. (Bryan Cave does not have any offices in Italy.)  Apparently, all billings are through the Chicago office, in U.S dollars. 

Martin has supported Nicola’s practice for many years, and he is a foreign contract partner for Bryan Cave, not an employee, thus he’s not on the firm's website. Although he worked in the U.S. for a while, Martin moved back to Italy during the pandemic and is currently working remotely from Milan. This works well for both Nicola and Martin because they are physically close to their Italian client base (and in the same time zone) but utilize many timekeepers within the U.S. for their inbound-to-U.S. practice.

Together, Nicola (the rainmaker) and Martin (whom Nicola is grooming to succeed him) have a practice representing over 100 Italian companies (mostly in the fashion and luxury goods industries, but also manufacturing and hospitality) who want to expand and do business in the US.  This practice generated between $3.5-3.8M in 2022.  On the right platform with no rate pressure, they believe they can exceed $6M.

Nicola and Martin also work with an Italian law firm and a CPA firm who currently provide them with referrals for US bound work.  In addition to the US work they do for their Italian clients, they want to pick up Italian work.  They would work with these firms, and hopefully have those firms join Rimon as well in a ""second wave.""  This would bring in another $5+M in business.

Nicola said they are looking to leave Bryan Cave because of unceasing rate pressure.  Nicola's Italian clients are balking at constant rate increases (his current rate is $1100, and Nicola said this is ""unsustainable."") 

Because of the referrals between Nicola/Martin and the other firms Nicola suggests that perhaps they could join Rimon US and not open a separate Italian entity that could ""compete"" with those firms (before they all possibly join). This structure is to be discussed further but would be similar to what they have at Bryan Cave.

This is a very exciting partner team and I highly recommend pursuing.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,"Via Tagliamento 55, 00198, Rome, Italy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ralph began his law career in litigation and his practice has evolved over the years to become over 50% focused on a wide range of environmental law including risk management, compliance, environmental permitting, impact-assessment, regulatory defense, internal investigations, health & safety, ESG/sustainability, and ADR. The majority of his clients are in the manufacturing, transportation, construction, mining, and commercial land development space.

Most of Sol's work comes from referrals (and a lot of that because people have seen him on TV).

He has worked in several smaller Maryland firms and between 2016-2022 ran his own solo practice.  The practice had 3-4 associates and 4-5 support staff.   

In 2022, his current firm (a small corporate transactional boutique) approached Gene to grow a litigation practice.  The firm promised Gene that it would have a lot of litigation work, very little of which materialized.  The firm has tried to cut some of his comp, even as he has brought in over $800k and he is now considering whether to reopen his own firm or join a larger platform.  He really wants to begin to transition his practice to push down work to younger attorneys.  If he were to join Rimon he would plan to bring two paras and an associate.  

Book is $750k-$1.1mm.  Rates are $450-685, and trending towards the higher number.  All work is portable.

Joe is an engaging financial institutions partner who advises his clients on a variety of corporate and regulatory matters including mergers & acquisitions, securitizations, strategic transactions, governance, international banking, payments, anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance, and private equity and venture capital investments.

Book is around $750,000.  Joe said that he is 100% confident that 80% of that is fully portable and the other 20% could be as well but he doesn't want to over promise.  His rate is $640 for corporate transactional work and $450-500 for regulatory work.  He is very self-sufficient and does not rely much on associates, paralegals or legal support staff.  He does not need office space.

Joe has moved around a lot in the past 10 years, but his reasons for each move seem logical.  In 2015 he went to Lock Lord from the Fed as a counsel but was there for less than 18 months because they misled him by telling him there would be bank regulatory work.  There was none.  So he moved to Schiff Hardin as a counsel, which did have the work.  He was there just over 18 months and would've stayed but the main bank client of the firm was hit with an enforcement action which halted all M&A deals. 

Faced with the prospect of having no work, Joe moved to Chapman & Cutler as a counsel.  Six months after he joined, the main banking partner and several associates left the firm.  Joe started doing corporate transactional work and the firm told him at his second review that they considered him a banking expert and that he was not going to be on a partnership track.

Faced with job uncertainty at Chapman, Joe left to join Howard & Howard as an equity partner (they had approached him).  Howard had a retiring partner and wanted Joe to join for succession planning.   Three years later there was a contentious CEO battle and Joe left for Dickenson along with the group with whom he had worked at Howard.  Thus, Joe has been working with the same group for over five years, across two firms.

Joe is interested in Rimon because while he very much likes the people at Dickinson, he feels as though he is siloed.  He would like the opportunity to work with more partners across more practice areas.

Joe is considering whether he is comfortable with Rimon's model.  I liked him and am satisfied with his reasons for moving around a lot.  If he is interested in continuing the process I recommend we do so.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,Edward,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Greg is a senior litigator who has practiced for 45 years.  For 42 years he was at Miller Canfield, a prominent Michigan firm.  He has had a book as large as $6mm at times but the last 4-5 years it has been closer to $1mm - all of which is fully portable.  His specialties include antitrust litigation, and he has also done a lot of entertainment litigation (talent side).  He is best friends with an attorney who is the former GC of both Ford Motor Co. and Coca Cola and his friend still regularly feeds him client work.

Greg likes his current firm but feels as though they want him to retire even though he loves practicing law and wants to continue doing so for the foreseeable future.  Additionally, there is almost no cross-selling at his current firm, and he would like to be at a firm where work flows to and from him.

Greg does not need an office.  He has an admin. assistant who has worked with him for more than 20 years who he would almost certainly want to bring with him.  He also has a longtime paralegal who he also might want to bring.  Finally, he is working with a non-partnership track attorney (clerk) who Greg says is very good and who he may or may not want to bring with him were he to join Rimon.

I liked Greg a lot. He is friendly and a ""litigator's litigator.""  He remains hungry and energetic, and I think he could be a great addition to Rimon.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to helping his former Fenwick colleague launch the US offices of Dottir, he was an associate at DLA Piper in San Diego, and an associate at Fenwick & West in Silicon Valley.  

Edgar's practice focuses on M&A, venture capital financings, and corporate counseling, and he has represented acquirers and target companies in over 200 transactions. Edgar is admitted in CA and his clients are mostly Silicon Valley based.  They have included companies such as Cisco, HP, Live Current Media, Symantec, and Qualcomm. He also has several acquisitions in the pipeline. In addition, Edgar is fluent in Spanish (oral & written).

During COVID, Edgar and his family relocated to Kansas to be closer to family, so Edgar works remotely and travels as necessary. He has faced a few obstacles with his current firm only having two US attorneys (and no associates) and has realized that as much as he loved opening the US offices and developing his own book of business, he needs a larger firm with more US-based resources to continue to build. 

Edgar believes that being part of a firm with both a remote/hybrid model and a national presence would be incredible for him, especially since the vast majority of his current firm is in Europe.

We did mention to them that we’d of course be willing to share financials - but also stated we’d need to put an NDA together if we are to progress to that stage.  

Before doing so, it would be good to hear from them if there’s genuine interest to further discussions based on the options we discussed (i.e. an outright buy-out with David and I remaining at the helm for up to 2 years to ensure a smooth transition - or alternatively, a more gradual buy out while we continue to work for the firm and generate revenue in the longer term). In the latter option, we would still be looking for a lump sum payment towards the overall purchase price of at least 25%.  

You of course already shared our general numbers with them and those were reiterated on our call with them as well.  

In any event, the overall purchase price we’re looking for would be in the region of 3 times gross sales as discussed, which has been typical in the Cayman market.  

We also let them know that we’re in the process of grooming one of our top salaried Partners for the Managing role.

If the above is a total non-starter we’d prefer to know now before sharing sensitive financials.

Daniel Lula is a litigation partner in Baker Hostetler's Orange County offices.  His practice involves employment and commercial litigation.  He went to Harvard Law and Stanford undergrad and joined Dewey Leboeuf, where he was mentored as a young associate by Paul Gupta.  Daniel is a New Englander and started his career in Boston but moved to California to join a litigation boutique.   He stayed for 15 years and made partner, and then went to Baker Hostetler to be part of a larger firm.   He now wants to return to the Boston area and is tired of BigLaw micromanagement.  He read Rimon's White Paper and remembered Paul and thinks Rimon would be a perfect fit for him. 

Daniel has longstanding clients (including Peraton, Inc. and the United Methodist Church) which makes up over 50% of his book ($1.3mm last year, on pace for the same this year).  The other 50% is one-off litigation matters which he said ""always come.""  Daniel wants to keep his CA practice and begin to build a East Coast practice (he has hired a marketing professional to help him do this).

He does not need an office other than for collaboration and the use of a conference room on occasion.  He utilizes 300-500 hours of associate time/year, particularly when he goes to trial (he has a trial set in September).  He would like to have a partner or associate to help him with his trials, and he also would want to try cases with a paralegal (he uses paralegal time sporadically).

Daniel appears to be very bright, driven and entrepreneurial.  I think he would make a fine addition to Rimon.",,,Business litigation – 50% / Employment litigation – 50%,350,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,"21 Fairway Dr., Dover, NH 03820",,1099,F,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Julian is a corporate/M&A partner who was trained at Paul Hastings for 10 years before moving to Pillsbury.  He started his career in China and eventually moved to Pillsbury's Northern California offices (he is California licensed).  His clients include start-ups, midsize M&A deals and Chinese companies seeking to do business in the US.  He does not represent SOEs (although the Chinese government has a small percentage ownership in some of his private company clients.

In 2021, Julian moved with another partner from Pillsbury to Venable but that move did not work because he needed a stronger international platform.  He moved to his current firm (Procopio) in 2022.  The firm has not helped him grow his practice and want him to have a book over $1mm despite the lack of help.  He needs lawyers who do CIFIUS, life sciences IP and international tax and his current firm does not have this expertise.  Rimon does.

Last year, Julian's book was $800k (his worst year in several).  He is on pace for $900k this year.  Rate is $800.

Julian does not need an office and does not utilize much associate time.  He did say he needs about 1/2 of a FT para's time.

Tim is a funds partner (hedge funds, fund managers, GPSs) who also has a blockchain, AI, crypto practice.  He is also an English solicitor who handles UK law for some clients.  His book is routinely at or over $5mm and his rate when he left Dechert was $1,650.

He spent several years at Dechert and made a move to McDermott.  Unfortunately for him, the McDermott move did not work out as there apparently was a conflict that fouled the move even after Tim made it.  He is now on his own since May and deciding amongst several firms as to his next steps.  He did not explain this situation in any detail to me and said he would do so if he decided to proceed with Rimon.

As for Rimon, Tim wanted to expand his search beyond traditional firms.  He understood and appreciated Rimon's model but is still speaking with several firms and will have to decide what he wants to do.

He does sometimes invest in his startup clients.

He has been fully remote for the last four years so does not need an office.  

Tim's practice is leveraged.  1/3 of the value of his book is his time (and 100% of his AI and blockchain practice is his time), the other 2/3 is other partners (ERISA, tax, blue sky filings) and associates.  He was unsure as to how much associate time he uses, but I suspect he would need an associate for himself.

Joseph has practiced at his current firm since 2011- ten years as a partner and has experience in most areas of litigation. Prior to joining his current firm, he was an associate with Gibson Dunn.

Joseph is looking for a firm with a national footprint, name recognition and a hybrid platform. He believes this would enable him to offer his clients a broader range of services while having more flexibility and autonomy. 

Joseph's clients are spread across multiple industries and range from high-net-worth individuals to large, publicly traded companies such as Match.com (which has been his client for 10 years). Joseph’s current firm is a regional, mid-market firm and he feels that there is a ""ceiling"" on the types of client matters he can bring to the firm. Moving to a national firm with more resources would open up additional opportunities that he is currently leaving on the table.

Joseph annually originates between $750k and $1mm and his hourly rates range between $600-$650/hr. He rarely does contingency work but when he has, he has used a hybrid model with good success.

Peter is a friendly and engaging real estate transactions partner.  He Peter advises on all types of complex commercial, industrial, mining, retail, hospitality, data
center/digital infrastructure, and multifamily and single-family real estate transactions across multiple jurisdictions (he is licensed in IL, WI  and MI).  

He is currently a partner affiliated with the Chicago offices of Loeb & Loeb, although he lives in Cleveland and works remotely.  Prior to joining Loeb in 2021, he was at Jones Day for over 10 years.  He likes the people he works with at Loeb but feels as though he is reaching a ceiling there, in part due to his remote status and in part because the firm will not commit associate help to him.

Peter has a book of $1.5-2mm (depending on if all clients port - he is confident of the $1.5 number).  Current rack rate is $995.  He utilizes a lot of paralegal time because he does not have access to associate help.  

Peter understands the Rimon model (he has friends who are partners at other ""distributed"" firms) and he would want to join and eventually sponsor one or two associates.  He has both in mind as two associates from his time at Jones Day are going to be leaving that firm and have expressed an interest in joining Peter.

Chris provides counsel to a variety of venture capital funds and to a broad range of companies, from start-ups to publicly-traded entities, in the fields of venture capital, mergers and acquisitions, banking, securities and general corporate law.   He also has a LatAm practice, representing some Mexican and S. American clients who set up entities in the US under DE law.

He has been at his firm since '08 but is considering Rimon for a couple of reasons.  First, his firm does not have skill sets that he needs to continue to grow - a LatAm practice and CIFIUS help (we have both) (he also cross-sells tax, employment, real estate, bank regulatory and fintech regulatory.  He also wants to split his time between South Carolina and NYC.  

Book is $800k, spread amongst 12-14 clients, the largest of which is $25k/month.  Rack rate is $795, discounted $695.

Chris said he works fairly independently, with little assistance from associates, paras or legal assistants, although he said he ""could use one FT associate.""  He does not need an office.

Jeff regularly handles entity formation, financing, real estate, intellectual property, business operations, distribution contracts, cannabis licensing, securities law, and regulatory compliance for his clients. Jeff's practice is both regional and national in scope, and he is admitted in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota. In addition to his client work, Jeff is a frequent lecturer, writer, blogger and podcast contributor.

Jeff is looking for a larger platform to continuing growing his practice. He currently has to refer work outside his firm.

Her clients include networks, production companies, brand and content owners, media and entertainment, talent, and food & beverage companies. Tami has a solid book of business and describes her clients as loyal.

In her practice, she oversees digital rights management, litigation strategies, trademark securitization and clearance, global growth initiatives, and traditional corporate finance.  She also handles various transactions related to intellectual property (but not prosecution), negotiations, and litigation before the TTAB including publicity rights, unfair competition, false advertising and infringement claims.

Prior to Dorsey, Tami practiced at Loeb & Loeb  (client and rate pressure) and Olshan Frome Wolosky (leaving opportunity on the table). Tami feels her current firm is consumed with metrics, not collaborative, not entrepreneurial, and she feels like a square peg in a round whole, and wants to be treated like an adult.

Tami is insightful, engaging, and entrepreneurial. She likes both Rimon's model and footprint. Tami is also an active member in INTA and would be a willing ambassador.

Wal-Mart wants her to move to Arkansas and she does not wish to do so, so she is considering her options.  If she were to join Rimon, she estimates that she would immediately bring at least $250k of Wal-Mart e-commerce work with her (she said she was being very conservative) and could also spin off other Wal-Mart work to others in IP, among other disciplines.  She also would reach out to all of her former clients when she was at VLP and Manatt.

Described himself as a ""generalist"" within the litigation space - has experience handling almost all types of criminal and civil cases (other than patent) and has taken about 200 cases to trial in his career; majority of his work comes from referrals, primarily outside of his current firm; he has 2-3 large recurring clients, the vast majority of his other work are one offs; been at current firm for almost 8 years and was recruited by the former MP (John) who passed away about 3 years ago; since then, partners running firm don't see eye to eye on mgmt style, especially not encouraging collaboration and collegiality that he enjoys in the practice of law; said he responded to his recruiter because his recruiter kept emailing and calling

Said he was proficient with technology, but not tech savvy; usually staffs most of his cases with 1-2 associates; one primary associate who does discovery, depo and trial prep, research, brief-drafting; uses paralegal occasionally, but not for anything substantive; uses Practice master for file mgmt, billing, time-keeping

has lots of logistical questions about Rimon model (wasn't familiar with it); seemed to catch on pretty quickly and referenced fact he had run his own firm before; he would like some more detail on benefits, office space in Philly, global revenue and lawyers at Rimon who practice in the PA/DE/MD/NJ/NY area; also mentioned he would need to market himself internally at Rimon and wanted to know how often others at firm would need a litigator in PA, although he has tried cases in several other jurisdictions across the country and would be willing to work with other Rimon clients who could use his trial experience

Comes across as friendly, very confident, and moderately interested; my concerns are that he might not find the in-person type of camaraderie and collegiality he is looking for at Rimon and also worry about his ability to handle technology",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,J,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Great potential group.  Glen is the senior partner and joined Armstrong Teadale in '22 after having his own firm for many years.  His group (now 12 lawyers, and also includes staff like billers a receptionist, etc.) makes up the most productive office in the firm and while the firm has treated them well they are not committing to growing its Miami presence.  Rimon does want to expand in Miami so this could be a good fit.

Glen wants office space for sure because he wants his team together.  Thye are like a family and all come into the office every day.

Glen originates 80% of their $7-8mm book.  He will move if his younger partners agree but he would be happy to stay as if that is what they decide.  Calendar 10 days to reach back out after he has had a chance to discuss Rimon with his partners.

Michael is a very friendly and engaging NY litigator. He said he has been fascinated with distributed law firms and in between stints at traditional firms started his own hybrid firm, growing it to 10-12 before he plateaued and went back into BigLaw.  He now is very interested in joining Rimon.

Michael is currently at Saul Ewing and is not satisfied with his growth, his comp and the fact that the firm is pushing everyone to go back into the office. 

His book is routinely between $800k-$1.2mm (he did have his worst year last year out of five years in at Saul (around $650k) and his major client is Verizon.  He also represents Verizon Wireless.  Some of these cases are hourly, some are hybrid, and some are contingency matters (""facilities litigation"" for when equipment is damaged by third parties).  He believes his main contact at Verizon could be giving him more work but that the contact does not like his current firm.  Michael also handles commercial litigation matters for other clients.

Michael cross sells corporate and IP work.  He does not need an office, nor does he need a full-time associate.  However, he currently does have associates working on his matters (which could be picked up by Rimon partners, associates or, in some cases, paralegals).

Rates are currently $965 (can discount to $875 without approval).

Personality-wise I think Michael would fit in wonderfully at Rimon.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before joining Holand & Hart, Loren was a partner at Stoel Rives, where he practiced 11 years and served as the co-leader of the firm’s Life Sciences practice group. Loren also spent two years in-house as IP counsel.

Loren has a thriving practice which is almost completely patent prosecution (U.S. and foreign). An important part of his client service is strategic counseling and advice. Loren has a solid client base with portables over $1mm. Most of his clients are in the life sciences area, though there are some that fall outside that realm such as medical devices, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and a few outliers within the strict chemical space.  A recent area of growth in his practice has been industrial designs, particularly work on consumer products, and he hopes to continue growing that particular area of his practice with his move.

The life sciences group at Holland & Hart used to be one of the largest practice groups within their firm but changes in the firm's direction have left Loren in a tiny subgroup and under-resourced. His firm is now focused on growing the computer science group which has also resulted in a diminished level of collaboration and cross-selling opportunities which were previously good.  

Loren has hourly billing arrangements for all his clients (current rack rate is $830/hr.) He is hoping to gain more control over his rates and use AFAs for specific international clients who are rate sensitive. Loren would plan to bring at least one associate, an IP specialist and a paralegal to support his practice.

Eric has been with his current Long Island firm for 20+ years.  The firm has a model that is similar to Rimon's, so he understands and appreciates us.  He also knows Anthony Acampora and Ken Silverman.

Eric is a litigator who also does some transactional work.  He is having trouble getting help in his firm and is also tired of being the de facto managing partner (and is not getting compensated for all of the back office work he is doing).

While he traditionally has a book in the $750k range, this year he has been extraordinarily busy, working every weekend, and is on pace for $1.2mm (which is an anomaly).  He has several longstanding clients (one such client, an individual, has given him 85 matters over the past 40 years. in addition to the work Eric currently does for that client, the client has work in Florida and Vegas that Eric cannot service at his current firm.  Similarly, the client will eventually have significant estate planning work which Eric cannot monetize at his current firm).  

In addition to current clients, Eric is turning away other work that he cannot do himself, including a large transaction from the owner of a car dealership chain.

Eric cross-sold $170k last year, which is in addition to his book.

Eric likes to go into the office periodically.  I believe there would be space for him in LI.  Rates are $625-650.  Eric also mentioned that there are a couple of attorneys at his firm that he could recruit to come with him and help him on his matters (need to explore why they are not helping him now).

Timing for a move would be August or early Fall.

I liked Eric a lot and think he could be a great fit.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

practice is primarily international tax (65%) with clients in lots of different countries, but most work comes from Western Europe, India, and South America, with a few others from Australia and other countries; clients are typically smaller matters with only occasional repeat business (no one client makes up more than 5% of his client base); current book is $450-600K, typical billable rate is $625/hr with possibility of raising it; he can live on Rimon compensation model at that level to start with, but is motivated to build practice; does have (inactive) FL bar license and would be open to activating that and doing both tax and T&E work in FL; also excited about Rimon's international footprint and specifically about Central/South America and UK as areas he would want to partner with Rimon lawyers who need international tax help; could probably use a few hours of help from a tax associate if that was available.

While Marcio generally likes his current firm and the people, the firm has gone through a transition from founding partners to a large board in the last 7 years. The transition has created divided focus and investing (mainly litigation and arbitration) and there have been several departures of rainmakers.

Joan is an accomplished and impressive candidate.  She focuses her practice on IP portfolio development and IP and commercial litigator.  She obtained her Ph.D. in jury psychology and wrote her dissertation while a 1L.

In 2013, Joan became a partner in Husch Blackwell's Food and Agribusiness group and was there for almost five years (she overlapped with and knows Patrick Kuehl as she was also in their KC offices).  There, she developed a strong practice that involves Canadian and US/Canadian cross border litigation.  In 2018 she turned down an equity position and joined what is now her primary client Ag Growth International (a Canadian company).  

She returned to private practice in March of last year and is moving to LA for family reasons.  She is considering leaving her current firm because the IP group is small (only five attorneys) and she is concerned about staffing on larger IP litigations.  She also said her comp is lower than it should be.

Joan has a $3mm book, a large majority of that work is from AGI.  She utilizes less than one FT paralegal and often uses 2-3 partners on her litigation matters.  We discussed that with a book of her size, she very likely should sponsor a FT associate at Rimon to ensure her work would be properly staffed.

Cross selling includes corporate (IPO, M&A).  There is not much now but definitely will be. 

She does not need a physical office. 

Timing for a move would be January '25 as she will be owed a significant bonus in December.

I think Joan would be a fantastic addition to Rimon.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kathryn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yan is a Chinese based, US trained partner candidate.  He is currently at a European firm in China and wants to move back to NYC.  He was initially at Clifford Chance where he was trained on corporate/M&A transactions.

Yan's book is currently $1.5mm made up of SOEs, private entities and PE funds and Yan said all of these clients are portable.  SOEs make up 1/3 of his book and he understands that Rimon would not want those entities as clients (so he needs to decide if we are the right move for him).  Current rack rate is $1300-1400, and he does discount from there.

Yan wants to move to NY sooner rather than later, although he has a six month notice clause in his partnership agreement (he thinks the firm would let him leave before then).  He would come to Rimon and focus on servicing his current work and expand from there to build a US based practice based on existing and new clients.

Yan says he would keep two junior associates or one mid-senior level and 1/2 of one junior associate busy.  I explained that he would have to sponsor any associate(s) and he understood and appreciated how that would work.  He also indicated he would utilize about 1/2 of a FT legal assistant but when I explained our pool system he said he was fine with that.  He does not need an office but does need conference room space (our new NYC office would suffice). 

Yan understood Rimon's model and is a very likable guy.  I think he could be a great addition to Rimon so long as he is comfortable not bringing his SOE clients and is on board with sponsoring his own associate(s).",,,"Corporate, 100%.",,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,"Room 3604 Building 7, 501 Xikang Road, Jing'an District, Shanghai",,W2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He advises professional and individual trustees on administration and fiduciary litigation matters, and his clients include executors, administrators and heirs in probate estates, trusts and guardianships. He has a broad practice, with clients that are high net worth individuals who require sophisticated drafting and advice, as well as more traditional and straight-forward wills/trusts drafting. His litigation clients are primarily closely held businesses.  Tom is a former member of his firm’s Board of Directors and Executive Committee. Tom is also an experienced arbitrator and mediator.
 
Tom is a rainmaker and generates revenue and manages the workload for himself and others in the firm. The bulk of his clients come through referrals, and he has a steady flow of business.

Kari is a seasoned litigator in Minneapolis.  She was at Lewis Brisbois for two years and was in a firm prior to that for many years where she was on the Management Board (the firm had financial issues which caused her to leave).  She has had a consistent book between $1-2M (usually between $1-1.5M) and worked well over 2000 hours/year (she was the top female biller in her firm).  Her hourly rates were $450-600 (averaging over $500).

In June 2022, Kari left LB because both her mother and son were ill and she said one of her partners had asked her to do something unethical.  The medical issues have resolved and Kari is eager to rejoin a firm.  

Kari was very confident that her clients will come back to her - she said that they have been very loyal and are constantly calling her and asking when she will return.  She can't guarantee the amount of business she will generate in her first 12 months, but seemed confident it would be well over $500,000 (she said she very much enjoys marketing her practice). Thereafter, she strongly believes her book will go back over $1M.

Ali and Allison come to us via recommendation of Daanish Hamid.  Ali and Daanish worked together at a prior firm and is Juan’s former Baker McKenzie colleague as well.  Ali and Allison have been a team for a long time. Their practice is bankruptcy/restructuring and commercial litigation.   

Ali is the senior partner, and his book is consistently $2-3M and sometime as high as $4M.  His work is a mixture of restructuring and commercial litigation.  Allison has been Ali's second in command but has her own clients as well.  This year, Ali believes he will be around $2.5M and Allison would add another $400k or so.

They also have another partner, Janet, who lives in Charleston who is excellent and who might also be interested in joining (although they have not yet discussed with her).

Ali is nearing Barnes' mandatory retirement age.  He could transition his clients to other Barnes partners and get paid to do so, but still wants to practice.

I found Ali and Allison to be friendly, engaging and very interested in the Rimon model.  I think they would be an excellent addition.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Has been on senior status at BCLP for about 5 years; over his career, he has done traditional RE development, financing, construction management/lending, and public/private p-ships; practice now is focused on representing municipalities and other clients in social impact P3s (US Virgin Islands is a client); before he went on senior status, his practice varied for $1.5-$3M/year - last 5 years it has been closer to $750K, mostly because he does not have anyone at BCLP who can do the work that he could originate; his mentee (young P) left for A&P recently and he has one RE associate, but she is very inexperienced and he does not feel comfortable transitioning client work and relationships to her; ideally looking for a place where he can have a younger partner to mentor, train, and transition client relationships to (he does not want to be a billing machine, but also has minimal expectations on comp needs) ; his current rate is $1350/hr and he bills out younger attorneys at $600-1000/hr

has been member of ULI for 30 years and is one of handful of governors and believes he could develop significant business from contact there if he had bench help to do it; has a CA client (SD) who he is doing 4-5 deals/yr with that could be 20 deals/year; fells like he could easily get his practice back to 1.5-3M within a year and he wants to share and pass along those client relationships to others

mentioned that Rimon's MP is a RE lawyer with ULI involvement and Greg was really excited about that; said he is looking at other distributed firms, but felt like quality, culture, and breadth of practice at Rimon sounded like a good fit",,,"adaptive reuses of office buildings involving tax increment financing and US DOT Build America Bureau financing in a number of US cities (50%), fund formation work in the attainable housing sector(25%)",,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,"2240 Central Park Avenue, Evanston, IL 60201",,,William,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He represents large, medium, and small employers (from Fortune 500 companies to mom-and-pop businesses) in a wide array of labor and employment matters, including litigation, alternative dispute resolution, and day-to-day advice and counsel. He has extensive experience defending high-stakes wage and hour class actions, derivative Private Attorney Generals Act lawsuits, and a variety of single-plaintiff employment matters.

Rob started his law career as an associate at Paul Hastings in 2013 and moved with a group of labor and employment lawyers to Venable, then to Epstein Becker and finally Nixon Peabody.  In his practice, Rob works closely with a 6th year associate, Alejandro Castro, who would transition with him. The majority of their work is wage and hour compliance. Together they bring a combined portable book of business of about $2.5mm with several clients that pay $20k flat fees per month. Rob's hourly rates range from $650-$1,000/hour depending on the type of matter and client. 

Rob defines his practice as less litigation and more quantifiable analysis. He has developed a system of analytics, checklists, budgets, calculators and workflow processes that help him “diagnose” his clients’ issues with efficiency and accuracy. He is then able to develop the appropriate strategies which often result in mediation and average approximately $200k-$250k per mediation. More complex cases can scale up to $1mm if the proceed to litigation.

Rob’s primary frustration with his current firm comes from continuing to originate clients but not seeing the full credit or revenue because he is not yet an equity partner.  Ongoing rate pressure adds to this frustration. Rob is impressed with Rimon's internal market collaboration and very interested in cross-selling and referral opportunities. If conversations progress favorably, there is a possibility that Rob may be able to convince an additional partner (commercial litigation) to make the move as well. 

Rob is very high energy, neurodivergent and very smart. He also has interest and experience in law firm pro bono and DEI. His practice appears to be a good fit for Rimôn and if the numbers bear out, we should continue the conversation.",,,"85% wage and hour advice and litigation; 15% employment advice and counsel, trade secrets, general litigation, reasoning through business problems, etc.",$350,Rimon,,,,,,,"possibly - A 6th-year Associate, Alejandro Castro ($250k) would port with Rob.

James is a very impressive and very friendly IP partner candidate.  He has been in BigLaw most of his career and is tired of the bureaucracy and paying for things he doesn't use or need.  Furthermore, his rate is $885/hour and will increase another 10% in '25 and his main client pays in Japanese Yen and he is facing considerable rate pressure as the Yen is devalued against the dollar.

James completely understood our model.

James' main client (85-90%) is HOYA, a Japanese corporation with 14 divisions.  HOYA makes eyeglasses, endoscopes, parts for smartphones and many other products sold directly to manufacturers/other companies (not consumers).  James does IP litigation as well as due diligence and counseling for them.   

He has had three litigations in the past three years.  Book is historically between $1-1.5mm. 
 He is confident that all of his patent prosecution work for HOYA ($700-800k) will follow him and there is also a trademark matter which may be worth $400k in fees that he would want to pitch for.  Any new litigations would also come to him.

James loves to cross sell.  In his first year at his current firm, he won the firm's ""collaboration award."" Cross selling includes corporate, advertising, L&E and is in addition to his stated book.

Sohan is a fantastic Rimon candidate.  Friendly, hungry, entreprenurial.  He is a litigator with a focus on international arbitration and white collar matters, but he also does commercial litigaiton as well.

Sohan had a career before the law and obtained a PhD. in international law before he graduated from law school in '16. Upon graduation, Sohan entered government service, where he served as Deputy General Counsel of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and as Special Counsel of the U.S. Department of Education (ED).  Thereafter, he joined a small firm (Shaerr Jaffe) where he had several friends.  The problem is that the firm only did political work and Sohan wanted to expand into commercial and white-collar work and wanted to join a larger firm.  So after one year at Shaerr, he joined Frost Brown Todd as a nonequity partner.  Weeks later Taft made him an equity partner offer that he was counseled by many colleagues not to refuse.

He was not looking to move when he received a call from the recruiter.  Because of our international reach and our compensation model Rimon was very interesting to him which is why he agreed to speak with us. 

In a short amount of time, Sohan has built a $1mm+ portable practice at Taft (current rates are $700-875/hour). Clients include governments, financial institutions and corporations in several industries.  He also has generated another $250-300k in cross selling, including tax, corporate (transnational agreements) and real estate.  He does not need office space (although he could use our N.Va. offices) .  He uses paralegal time to format briefs and for proofreading, and he gives maybe 400 hours/year to associates, so he is largely self-sufficient.

As he was not looking to leave his current firm, and because he is early in his legal career, Sohan wants some time to consider whether now is the right time to join Rimon.  I hope he decides it is.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Holly has a thriving practice advising high-net-worth individuals, family-owned conglomerates, and corporate executives on trust law, estate tax, breach of fiduciary duty and corporate matters and has experience in trust litigation representing trustees and beneficiaries. 

One of her largest cases involved over $200mm worth of assets, 12 partnerships and a corporation.

Holly likes the global reach of Rimon and the hybrid platform. Holly has other potential clients that she has not been able to bring in because of the limited reach of her current firm. She has many regional and U.S. clients, but also has an extensive global network in the Middle East, India, and Dubai (she previously lived and worked as a legal consultant in Dubai). She believes a move to Rimon would open up additional opportunities to grow her business. 

At her current firm, attorneys are highly encouraged to work on institutional clients rather than originate their own. Holly would like to continue building her business and is looking for a firm more focused on innovation and collaboration. She was very excited about our model and is confident that she could add value. Holly typically refers securities, tax and family law matters. Holly is admitted to practice in California and D.C.

He has special expertise in crypto.  He also has a strong disputes resolutions background and does handle some litigation matters.

Brian describes himself as a rainmaker who develops business across multiple practice areas (litigation, crypto, privacy, real estate, sports/entertainment, etc.).  His book this year is $2mm but he would have to consider how much of that work would follow him as many of his partners are actively engaged on several matters.  Brian is confident at least half of his book would follow and that he could quickly ramp up from there.

Brian spent 10 years at Jones Day (doing litigation and arbitrations along with corporate matters) before joining Loeb & Loeb.  From there, in 2013, Brian launched a crypto/financial services company and then in 2020 launched his own outsource consulting/general counsel firm (where he said he made more money in his first year than he ever did at a law firm).  He joined his current firm in '21 when one of his partners who was working on one of Brian's client's matters suggested it on the golf course.  

Brian likes the people at Lowenstein but he thinks they might not be the right fit for him.  He does not think the firm has a long enough reach or a deep enough bench across multiple practice areas.  Brian considers himself to be a ""hub,"" constantly networking and generating business that he hands off to other partners and there is not enough cross selling.

Brian cannot personally handle all of the work that he brings in.  He originates work (IP, employment, tax (private wealth), bankruptcy, disputes, etc.) and hands that work to his partners who do use associates.  Brian himself does not occupy the time of a single associate or paralegal although many associates and paras bill time to his matters through the working partners.  He has one current FINRA matter on which a paralegal is billing ""hundreds"" of hours.

Brian also has a putative contingency fee case involving market manipulation by banks that he would be interested in exploring if he were to join Rimon.  He said that case could ""dwarf"" his other matters and he would like to discuss logistics of this potential case, including litigation financing, reduced hourly rates with a success fee, etc.

He needs no office (although he would go into the Long Island office periodically and sometimes meet clients in Manhattan).  He also does not need a legal assistant and describes himself as tech savvy.

Current rate $1,290.

As I said above, Brian is very confident and very talkative.  But I liked him and I think he might be a good fit for Rimon.",,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rachel was a candidate back in '22 and almost joined but she decided to join Snell instead.  Even then, she thought she was making a mistake, and it turns out she probably did.  Snell has a lot of red tape, an 1800 hour/year requirement for partners and a whole bunch of rules about what clients she can bring onboard.

Her book is currently around $1mm, which is lower than it recently had been, because one of her largest clients went bankrupt and two others closes shop.  But she is still busy and, in addition to her current book (which consists of many longstanding clients), she has a lot of potential clients on the cusp.

She does use associate and paralegal time and will look at her numbers to determine the exact amount of support that she utilizes.  She also continues to cross sell IP,  L&E, bankruptcy, litigation.  

She does not need an office.

I hope we land her this time!",,,Mergers & Acquisitions- 40% General Corporate- 40% Tax/Non-Profit- 20%,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,"124 8th Street, #6, Huntington Beach, CA 92648",,,Ann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lisel counsels clients on patent, trademark and copyright prosecution worldwide, and intellectual property litigation throughout the United States. Her practice focuses on computer hardware and software, sporting goods, apparel, Internet, entertainment, medical devices, agricultural products and services, and consumer goods.   She is quite friendly and conversational.

She has been at her firm since '05 and is looking because the firm management has changed, and she does not agree with the direction the firm is moving towards.  They have lost several partners recently.

Lisel does not need an office but does like to go in periodically, mostly for camaraderie.  Her practice requires the help of associates (12-1300 hours/year) and paralegals (1800-2000 hours).  She has had the same legal assistant for the past 15 years and would love to bring her but would have to decide if that makes sense.  Rack rate is $785, but she usually charges clients $660-70.  Cross selling includes corporate, employment and some T&E.

With respect to our last call, I have prepared and attached a starting point for discussions with respect to financials.  We made the following assumptions with respect to projections:

1.  Our current book is about US$ 5 Million.  We assume that in our first year leaving our firm, it would drop to US1 Million, second year $2 Million and third year $3 Million.  It is very simplistic, but probably relatively accurate.

2.  Our rental expenses would be kept a minimum because we will try to sublease from our JV partners in the three jurisdictions.

3.  We wish to keep the associate count low to be in harmony with the overall hybrid cloud based philosophy of Rimon.

4.  One of our partners is out, so we have the three remaining partners, Philip, Aaron, and myself.

5.  With respect to the Rimon fees, we were proposing a lower fee of 10%, but increasing to 15% the second year and 17.5 the third year.  This should result in cash flow to Rimon of over $40,000 per month by said time.",,,Represents a lot of the Kuwaiti banks and oil companies,,,,,,,,,,converted as per MBM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.8374240000073523e+18,,False,,,,Candidate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,2021-06-13,,,2022-06-30,,,,,,,2019-11-06,,2020-05-31,,,True,,2025-03-19,,,,,,,Rimon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That can be a good thing or a bad thing. It is good since it was an extremely high-level position of a multi-billion-dollar company. It is bad since the company famously imploded. Overall, I think it would bring experience to our firm that we do not have (in-house real estate experience) and some PR. Before WeWork, she was a partner at Wilmer Hale (a very elite law firm) with a book of business of $4mil. I think she made good money at WeWork, but I don't know. She was probably a billionaire on paper for a while.
